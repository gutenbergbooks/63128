<p>“Il n’y a point de machines plus communes que les serrures: elles sont assez
composées pour mériter le nom de <i>machine</i>; mais je ne sais s’il y en a qui
soient aussi peu connues par ceux qui les emploient. Il est rare qu’on sache en
quoi consiste la bonté d’une serrure, le degré de sûreté qu’on peut s’en promettre.
Leur extérieur est presque la seule chose à quoi l’on s’arrête. Les usages importans
auxquels elles sont employées devraient cependant exciter la curiosité
à les connaître, si la curiosité était toujours excitée raisonnablement.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">M. de

<p>“There are no machines more common than locks: they are sufficiently complex
to merit the name of <i>machine</i>; but I know of no others the structure of
which is so little understood by those who use them. It is rare to find any one
who knows wherein the goodness of a lock consists, or the degree of security that
he can attach to it. The outside of a lock is usually all that attracts attention.
Doubtless the important uses to which locks are applied would excite curiosity
respecting their structure, if curiosity were always excited for worthy objects.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">M.

<p>In August 1852, being about to write a short article on
Locks for a Cyclopædia of Useful Arts, of which I am the editor,
I consulted my esteemed and lamented friend, the late Professor
Cowper, of King’s College, as to the desirability of explaining to
the general reader the defects of some of our English locks, which,
previous to the celebrated “lock controversy” of 1851, had borne
a high character for skilful construction, beauty of workmanship,
and undoubted security. Professor Cowper expressed his strong
conviction that by exposing the defects of our locks, the cause of
mechanical science, as well as the public in general, would be
benefited; that if our locks were defective, inventors would be
stimulated to supply the defects, and the art of the locksmith
would be raised accordingly. He considered that Mr. Hobbs had
made a considerable step in advance in the constructive details of
his art, not only in having detected the weak points of some of
our best English locks, but also in having introduced two or three
new locks, which appeared to be more secure than any of those
previously produced. Professor Cowper gave me an introduction
to Mr. Hobbs, who placed at my disposal a variety of literary
materials relating to the history and construction of locks, and
stated his intention at some future time of bringing out a small
book on the subject, if he could meet with a publisher. I recommended
him to offer the work to Mr. Weale, for insertion in his
series of Rudimentary Works. This was accordingly done, and I
was invited to prepare the work; but as my engagements did not
leave me sufficient leisure to write the book, I requested my friend
Mr. George Dodd to put the materials together, and to search for<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevi">[vi]</span>
more. Mr. Dodd acceded to my request; and having completed
his part of the work, I subjected it to a careful revision, and added
various details which seemed to be necessary to completeness, at
least so far as the narrow limits of a small rudimentary work would
admit of completeness. The manuscript was then sent to press:
each sheet as it was received from the printer was submitted to
Mr. Hobbs, who read it with care, and made his annotations and
corrections thereon. Mr. Hobbs and I then had a meeting, when
the additions and corrections were read and discussed, and admitted
or rejected as the case might be. The sheet having been
thus corrected was sent to press.</p>

<p>It should also be stated that, during the progress of the work,
Mr. Weale, at my request, wrote to Messrs. Bramah, and also to
Messrs. Chubb, informing them that a Rudimentary Treatise on
the Construction of Locks was being prepared, and requesting
them to state in writing what alterations or improvements they
had made in their locks since the date of the Great Exhibition.
The communications which we have received from these celebrated
firms are inserted <i>verbatim</i>, in their proper places, in the present
work.</p>

<p>Such is the mode in which this small volume has been prepared.
I have endeavoured to perform an editor’s duty conscientiously,
without entertaining the feeling of a partisan in the matter. My
chief object in superintending the production of this book (an object
in which the Publisher fully participates) is to advance the
cause of mechanical science, and to supply a deficiency in one of
the most interesting portions of its English literature.</p>

<p>In reference to Mr. Smyth’s letter, which is given at
<a href="#Page130">pp. 130</a>, <a href="#Page131">131</a>, that gentleman is desirous to state that
it was in consequence of the defects there pointed out
that Mr. Hobbs was enabled to pick the Bramah lock
operated upon, which had been manufactured forty
years previously, when the sliders were made of iron
instead of steel as they now are, and yet, notwithstanding
that and the other defects pointed out, it
took Mr. Hobbs sixteen days to pick it. In proof of
the security of the Bramah lock, Mr. Smyth mentions
that Mr. Hobbs’s best workman failed in picking an
ordinary 3-inch Bramah box lock; and that a person
in the employ of Messrs. Johnson and Ravey, of Conduit
Street, failed also in his attempt to pick a 6-inch
cellar-door lock, though he had the lock in his possession
for twelve months, employing his evenings in
making instruments and trying to pick it. Mr. Smyth
contradicts the statement made at <a href="#Page128">page 128</a>, that the
new lock was removed from the window through any
fear of its being opened. On the contrary, it was put
up especially to afford an opportunity for Mr. Hobbs
to make, if he thought fit, another trial, and it remained
in the window four months. The sole cause of
its removal was to stop the impertinent applications of
men and boys, which interfered too much with the
general business of the firm.</p>

<p class="center highline4">ON THE<br />
<span class="fsize200">CONSTRUCTION OF LOCKS.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER I.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">ON LOCKS AND LOCK-LITERATURE.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The manufacture of locks, and a consideration of the mechanical
principles involved in their construction and security,
have never yet been treated with any degree of fulness in an
English work. Lock-making has occupied a large amount of
ingenuity, and lock-patents have been obtained in considerable
number, though not always, we are satisfied, with a commensurate
return for the expense incurred,&mdash;but lock-philosophy
(if so it may be designated) has not been largely attended to.</p>

<p>And yet it may safely be said that much which is both
mechanically and commercially important is comprised in a
lock. Every improvement in the manufacture of iron, steel,
and brass&mdash;that is, in the tool-making and machine-making
processes&mdash;may be made to reflect its light on the lock-manufacture;
the stamping, the casting, the planing, the
slotting, the screw-cutting, the polishing of metals,&mdash;all, in
proportion as they are improved, impart some of their aid
to the lock-maker. Then, in the finer kinds of locks, the
works are so delicate as to approach to the nicety of clockwork;
thereby combining the manipulative skill of a talented<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
artisan with the rougher mechanical work of the smith. The
principles of mechanical science are also appreciated by many
lock-makers. The lever, the inclined plane, the eccentric, the
cam, the screw, the wheel and pinion, the ratchet, the spring,&mdash;all
are brought to bear on the internal mechanism of locks,
frequently in many novel combinations.</p>

<p>The commercial importance of locks&mdash;though of course
never seriously questioned when once fairly brought before
one’s attention&mdash;has been recently rendered so apparent as to
have risen to the position of a public topic. If a strong room,
containing gold and silver, notes and bills, books and papers&mdash;if
such a room be necessarily shielded from intrusion, it becomes
no less necessary that the shield should be really worthy of
its name, trusty and reliable: a good lock is here nearly as
indispensable as a faithful cashier. And without dwelling on
such an auriferous picture as a room fall of gold, we shall
find ample proof of the commercial importance of lock-making
in the ordinary circumstances by which we are every day
surrounded. Until the world becomes an honest world, or
until the honest people bear a larger ratio than at present to
the dishonest, the whole of our movables are, more or less, at
the mercy of our neighbours. Houses, rooms, vaults, cellars,
cabinets, cupboards, caskets, desks, chests, boxes, caddies,&mdash;all,
with the contents of each, ring the changes between <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i> pretty much according to the security of the locks by
which they are guarded.</p>

<p>A commercial, and in some respects a social, doubt has
been started within the last year or two, whether or not it is
right to discuss so openly the security or insecurity of locks.
Many well-meaning persons suppose that the discussion respecting
the means for baffling the supposed safety of locks offers
a premium for dishonesty, by shewing others how to be dishonest.
This is a fallacy. Rogues are very keen in their
profession, and know already much more than we can teach
them respecting their several kinds of roguery. Rogues knew
a good deal about lock-picking long before locksmiths discussed<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
it among themselves, as they have lately done. If a
lock&mdash;let it have been made in whatever country, or by
whatever maker&mdash;is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been
deemed to be, surely it is to the interest of <i>honest</i> persons
to know this fact, because the <i>dishonest</i> are tolerably certain
to be the first to apply the knowledge practically; and the
spread of the knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those
who might suffer by ignorance. It cannot be too earnestly
urged, that an acquaintance with real facts will, in the end,
be better for all parties. Some time ago, when the reading
public was alarmed at being told how London milk is adulterated,
timid persons deprecated the exposure, on the plea
that it would give instructions in the art of adulterating milk;
a vain fear&mdash;milkmen knew all about it before, whether they
practised it or not; and the exposure only taught purchasers
the necessity of a little scrutiny and caution, leaving them to
obey this necessity or not, as they pleased. So likewise in
respect to bread, sugar, coffee, tea, wine, beer, spirits, vinegar,
cheap silks, cheap woollens&mdash;all such articles as are susceptible
of debasement by admixture with cheaper substances&mdash;much
more good than harm is effected by stating candidly
and scientifically the various methods by which such debasement
has been, or can be produced. The unscrupulous have
the command of much of this kind of knowledge without our
aid; and there is moral and commercial justice in placing on
their guard those who might possibly suffer therefrom. We
employ these stray expressions concerning adulteration, debasement,
roguery, and so forth, simply as a mode of illustrating
a principle&mdash;the advantage of publicity. In respect
to lock-making, there can scarcely be such a thing as dishonesty
of intention: the inventor produces a lock which he
honestly thinks will possess such and such qualities; and he
declares his belief to the world. If others differ from him in
opinion concerning those qualities, it is open to them to say
so; and the discussion, truthfully conducted, must lead to
public advantage: the discussion stimulates curiosity, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
curiosity stimulates invention. Nothing but a partial and
limited view of the question could lead to the opinion that
harm can result: if there be harm, it will be much more than
counterbalanced by good.</p>

<p>The literature of lock-making is, as we have implied, very
scanty, both in England and America. The French and Germans,
though far below our level as lock-makers, are very superior
to us in their descriptions of the construction and manufacture
of locks. Take, for instance, the French treatise published
more than eighty years ago by the <i>Académie des Sciences</i>,
and forming part of a folio series of manufacturing treatises,
illustrated very fully by engravings. It is worth while to examine
this work, to see how minutely and faithfully the writers
of such treatises performed their task nearly a century ago.
The <i>Art du Serrurier</i>, with the distinguished name of M. Duhamel
du Monceau as the author or editor, was published in
1767. It occupies 290 folio pages, and is illustrated by 42
folio plates. The first chapter gives us an introduction and
general principles, in which the choice and manipulation of
materials are touched upon; the different qualities of iron and
steel; and the processes of forging, founding, welding, stamping,
filing, polishing, &amp;c. In the copper-plates representing
these smiths’ operations and the tools employed,<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> there
is a smithy, with about a dozen smiths engaged in all these
various occupations, with stockings down, and a due amount
of workshop slovenliness. The next chapter takes us into
what may perhaps be called “smith’s work in general,” or
at least it treats of the manufacture of various kinds of ironmongery
for doors, windows, and house-fittings generally.
Then the third chapter treats of “smith’s work which serves
for the security of houses,” consisting of railings, palings,
bars, and gates of various kinds&mdash;such at least as are made
of iron. In chapter four we have a notice of such kinds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
smith’s work as relate to the fastenings for doors, windows,
closets, chests, &amp;c.; such as hinges, hasps, latches, bolts, and
other contrivances less complex than an actual lock. This
brings us, by a natural transition, to locks in general, which
form the subject of chapter five, to which is attached the illustrious
name of M. de Réaumur as the author. Here are given
a hundred folio pages of description, illustrated by twenty folio
plates relating to locks, lock-making, and locksmiths. The
sixth chapter relates to the iron-work of carriages, or the
labours of the coachsmiths; while chapter seven, to wind up
the work, relates to bell-hanging.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
It is worthy of remark, that the tools described are the same as those
which are used by the locksmith at the present day; shewing how little
improvement has been made in the means of producing locks.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>That chapter of the work which has reference to locks is
the only one with which we have to do here. It is arranged
in a systematic manner, beginning with the simpler locks,
without wards or tumblers, and proceeding thence to others of
more complex construction. The period at which the work
was written was too early to lead us to expect to find a
tumbler-lock described and delineated: there are, however,
numerous examples of single tumbler-locks, many of them of
great ingenuity. The use of multiple bolts, that is, of many
bolts shot at once by one action of the key, seems to have been
familiar enough to the locksmiths of those days. One lock represented
is remarkable; it is attached to a strong and ponderous
coffer or chest. The chest is open; and the whole under
or inner surface of the cover is seen to be occupied by a lock
of intricate construction; there are no less than twelve bolts,
three on each long side, one on each short side, and one in
each corner; these bolts are so placed as to catch under a projecting
rim fixed round the top of the coffer. The collection
of keys, exhibited on a separate plate, is remarkable for the
great variety of forms given to them. We shall by and by
copy some of the drawings of this curious work.</p>

<p>It was to be expected that in the <i>Encyclopédie Méthodique</i>,
published in the same country and in the same century, the
locksmith’s art would be treated at some such length as in the
work just described. Among the two hundred volumes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
which the <i>Cyclopédie</i> consists, several are devoted to arts and
manufactures; and one of them contains the article in question.
It occupies 168 quarto pages, and is illustrated by 35 copper-plate
engravings, shewing in detail not only the parts of various
locks, but the tools used by the lockmaker. It is proper,
however, to remark, that much of the letterpress and many
of the plates relate to smith’s work generally, and not exclusively
to lock-work; the French name <i>serrurerie</i> being
applied not only to lock-making, but to most of the smith’s
work required in dwelling-houses. This affords, indeed, a
striking illustration of the fact, that until lately a lock-maker
has been regarded rather as a smith than as a machinist,
rather as a forger and filer of pieces of iron, than as a
fabricator of delicate mechanism. One of the most curious
features in this treatise is a vocabulary, containing, in alphabetical
arrangement, a minute account of all the French technical
terms employed in the locksmith’s art. This vocabulary
alone occupies 38 quarto pages.</p>

<p>The Germans, like the French, bestow great attention on
their treatises relating to the manufacturing arts. Some of
these are, indeed, worked up to a degree of minuteness
which would seem superfluous, where little distinction is
drawn between the importance of fundamental principles and
that of mere technical details. Locks have had their due
share. The article on locks in Prechtl’s <i>Technological Encyclopædia</i>
written by Karmarsch, and published in 1842,
occupies about 140 pages. Locks are very minutely classified
by the author, according to their purposes and their
modes of action, and are illustrated by many plates. One of
his classifications is into <i>German</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>Bastard</i> locks,
referring in part to the extent to which the key turns round
in the lock; and the last of the three having an intermediate
character between the other two. After treating of the ordinary
warded locks, he comes to the combination principle;
and it is profitable here to notice, how well the works of our
machinists are understood on the continent, when they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
any thing to recommend them; there are a dozen closely
printed pages devoted to a minute description of Bramah’s
invention, with all the separate parts illustrated by copper-plate
engravings. After this comes a more general account
of the details and manufacture of locks, similarly illustrated
by engravings.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the merits of the different articles relating
to locks in the various English cyclopædias, there are
none approaching in length to the article in Prechtl’s work.
But when we consider that Prechtl devotes twenty large volumes
to technological or manufacturing subjects, he is of
course able to devote a larger space to each article than is
given in English works. Both in England and in America,
men are more disposed to do the work than to describe it
when done. In the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, in Rees’ <i>Cyclopædia</i>,
in Hebert’s <i>Engineers’ and Mechanics’ Cyclopædia</i>, in
the <i>Encyclopædia Metropolitana</i>, in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>, and
in other similar works, locks are described as well as can
be expected within the limits assigned to the articles. Mr.
Bramah’s essay on locks, and on his own lock in particular,
is one of the few English pamphlets devoted expressly to this
subject. An excerpt from the proceedings of the Institute of
Civil Engineers, in 1851, gives an interesting paper on locks
by Mr. Chubb; and shorter reports of papers and lectures
have been published in various ways. Perhaps the best account
of locks which we have, considering the limited space
within which a great deal of information is given in a very
clear style, is that contained in Mr. Tomlinson’s <i>Cyclopædia of
Useful Arts</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER II.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">ANCIENT LOCKS: GRECIAN, ROMAN, EGYPTIAN.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">Locks and door-fastenings have not, until modern times, been
susceptible of any classified arrangement according to their
principles of construction. They have been too simple to require
it, and too little varied to permit it. That some such fastenings
must be employed wherever doors of any kind are used
is sufficiently apparent; and there is a little (though only a
little) information obtainable, which shews the nature of the
fastenings adopted in early times. The bolt, the hasp, the chain,
the bar, the latch, the lock, all were known, in one or other of
their various forms, in those ages which we are accustomed to
consider classical. Travellers, generally speaking, do not descend
to locks, or rather they do not think about them;
otherwise they might have collected much that would have
been novel and applicable to the present work; and, indeed,
there is some ground for the assertion, that a notice of the
door-fastenings of all nations would reveal to us something
of the social and domestic habits of various members of
the great human family. Be this as it may, however, we
may profitably make a little inquiry into the locks of ancient
times.</p>

<p>In the volumes of Lardner’s <i>Cyclopædia</i> relating to the
“Manners and Customs of the ancient Greeks and Romans,”
we do not find any mention of the kinds of locks used by those
nations; but the author, while describing the houses, says:&mdash;“Doors
turned anciently upon large pivots in the centre, let
into sockets in the lintel and threshold, so that one of the sides
opened inwards, the other outwards; and Plutarch gives the
following curious reason why persons were to knock and<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
alarm the porter, viz. lest the visitor entering unawares
should surprise the mistress or daughter of the family busy or
undressed, or servants under correction, or the maids quarreling.”
As the visitors had thus the power (if permitted so to
do) to open the outer door of a house, it would appear that
very little in the nature of a lock was employed under ordinary
circumstances, unless indeed it were a mere latch. In
respect to Roman houses it is stated, that “the doors revolved
upon pivots, which worked in a socket below, and were fastened
by bolts which hung from chains.” There is no mention
of locks here. Mr. St. John, in his work on the same subject,
says: “The street-door of a Grecian house, usually, when
single, opened outwards; but when there were folding-doors
they opened inwards, as with us. In the former case it was
customary, when any one happened to be going forth, to knock,
or call, or ring a bell, in order to warn passengers to make
way.” After describing the various kinds of wood of which
the doors were made, he proceeds: “The doors at first were
fastened by long bars passing into the wall on both sides; and
by degrees smaller bolts, hasps, latches, and locks and keys,
succeeded. For example, the outer door of the thalamos in
Homer was secured by a silver hasp, and a leathern thong
passed round the handle, and tied, perhaps, in a curious knot.”</p>

<p>Mr. Yates, in a learned article on this subject in Smith’s
<i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</i>, collects numerous
details scattered through various early writers. We will string
together a few of these details, so far as they have any relation
to the fastenings of doors. The outer door of a Roman house
was generally called <i>janua</i>; whereas the inner doors were
called <i>ostia</i>. The doorway, when complete, consisted of four
indispensable parts&mdash;the threshold or sill, the lintel, and the
two jambs. The threshold, on which the feet trod, was often
regarded with a kind of superstitious reverence; the lintel,
which crossed the doorway at the top, having a considerable
superincumbent weight to bear, was usually made of one
piece of timber or stone of great strength; the jambs, or side<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
uprights, were also made in one piece each. The doorway, in
every building of the least importance, contained two doors
folding together; even the internal doors had their bivalve construction.
But in every case each of the two valves was wide
enough to allow persons to pass through without opening the
other; in some cases even each valve was double, so as to fold
like our window-shutters. These doors, or valves, were not
hinged to the side-posts, as with us, but were, as has already
been stated, pivoted to the lintel above and the threshold below.
The fastening usually consisted of a bolt placed at the
base of each valve or half-door, so as to admit of being pushed
into a socket made in the sill to receive it. The doorways in
some of the houses at Pompeii still shew two holes in the sill,
corresponding to the bolts in the two valves. At night, the
front door of the house was further secured by means of a
wooden and sometimes an iron bar placed across it, and inserted
into sockets on each side of the doorway; hence it was
necessary to remove the bar in order to open the door.
Chamber-doors were often secured in the same manner. In
the <i>Odyssey</i> there is mention of a contrivance (adverted to by
Mr. St. John) for bolting or unbolting a door from the outside;
it consisted of a leather thong inserted through a hole in
the door, and by means of a loop, ring, or hook, capable of
taking hold of the bolt so as to move it in the manner required.
We have here evidently the elements of a more complete
mechanism; for the bolt was a rude lock in the same
degree that the thong was a rude key. That the Romans
afterwards had real locks and keys is clear; for the keys found
at Herculaneum and Pompeii, and those attached to rings,
prove that a kind of warded lock must have been well known.<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
There are the remains of a tomb at Pompeii, the door of which
is made of a single piece of marble, including the pivots, which
were encased in bronze, and turned in sockets of the same
metal; it is three feet high, two feet nine inches wide, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
four and a quarter inches thick; it is cut in front to resemble
panels, and thus approaches nearer in appearance to a modern
wooden door; and it was fastened by some kind of lock, traces
of which still remain.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote2"></a><a href="#FNanchor2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> An examination of the Roman keys in the British Museum sufficiently
attests this fact.</p>

</div>

<p>The same facts frequently become more clear when described
in different words by different writers. We shall
make use of this circumstance. Mr. Donaldson, in his <i>Essay
on Ancient Doorways</i>, presents us with details which illustrate
many of the foregoing remarks. “Homer describes the treasures
and other valuable objects (mentioned in the <i>Odyssey</i>)
as being kept in the citadel, secured merely by a cord intricately
knotted. This, of course, was soon found to be a very
insufficient protection, and therefore a wooden bar was adopted
inside the doors of houses, to which it was attached by an iron
latch, fastened or removed by a key adapted to it; this key
was easily applied from within; but in order to get at it from
without, a large hole was made in the door, allowing the introduction
of the hand, so as to reach the latch and apply the
key. The lock called the Lacedæmonian, much celebrated by
ancient writers, was invented subsequently; it was especially
fitted for the inner chambers of houses, the bar fastenings continuing
to be employed for closing the outer doors of dwellings
and the entrance-gates to cities. The Lacedæmonian lock did
not require a hole to be made in the door, for it consisted of
a bolt placed on that side of the entrance-door which opened,
and on the inside of a chamber-door. When a person who
was outside wished to enter, it was necessary for him to insert
the key in a little hole and to raise the bolt; and in time
this species of fastening was improved by the insertion of the
bolt in an iron frame or rim permanently attached to the door
by a chain, and fastening the door by the insertion of the hasp,
through the eye of which was forced the bolt inside the lock
by applying the key.” After quoting a Latin sentence from
Varro in elucidation of his subject, Mr. Donaldson proceeds to
observe, that for the most part the locks of the ancients were
different in principle from those of modern days, not being inserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
or mortised into the doors, nor even attached except by
a chain; they were, in fact, padlocks.</p>

<p>One of the passages in the <i>Odyssey</i> alluding to the primitive
mode of fastening the valves or folding-doors of a house
runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Most of the other great nations of antiquity resembled
either the Egyptians or the Greeks and Romans, more or less
closely, in their domestic and domiciliary arrangements; or,
at any rate, so far as such humble matters as locks and keys
are concerned, we need not seek far from those nations for
examples. The Nineveh and other Assyrian explorations
have, however, revealed many curious and unexpected facts;
from the temples and the palaces we may by and by penetrate
into the houses and rooms of the citizens sufficiently to
know how their doors were fastened. In the mean time
ancient Egypt awaits our notice.</p>

<p>Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson, in his <i>Manners and Customs of the
Ancient Egyptians</i>, gives the following information concerning
the doors and door-fastenings of that remarkable people, on
the authority of models, sculptures, and paintings, still existing.
The doors were frequently stained so as to imitate foreign
and rare woods. They were either of one or two valves, turning
on pieces of metal, and were secured within by a bar or by
bolts. Some of these bronze pins have been discovered in the
tombs of Thebes; they were fastened to the wood with nails of
the same metal, the round heads of which served also as ornaments.
In the stone lintels and floors behind the thresholds
of the tombs and temples are still frequently to be seen the
holes in which the pivot-pins turned, as well as those of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
bolts and bars, and the recess for receiving the opened valves.
The folding-doors had bolts in the centre, sometimes above as
well as below; a bar was placed across from one wall to the
other.</p>

<p>In many of the ancient Egyptian doors there were wooden
locks fixed so as to fasten across the centre at the junction
where the two folds of the door met. It is difficult, by mere
inspection of the bas-reliefs and paintings, to decide whether
these locks were opened by a key, or were merely drawn backwards
and forwards like a bolt; but if they were really locks,
it is probable that they were on the same principle as the Egyptian
lock still in use. For greater security, these modern locks
are occasionally sealed with a mass of clay; and there is satisfactory
evidence that the same custom was frequently observed
among the ancient inhabitants of that country. Sir
J. G. Wilkinson gives a representation of an iron key, now in
his possession, which he procured among the tombs at Thebes,
and which looks very much like a modern burglar’s picklock.
In relation to keys generally, and after mentioning the use of
bronze for their manufacture, he says: “At a later period,
when iron came into general use, keys were made of that
metal, and consisted of a straight shank about five inches in
length, and a bar at right angles with it, on which were three
or more projecting teeth. The ring at the upper extremity
was intended for the same purpose as that of our modern keys;
but we are ignorant of the exact time when they were brought
into use; and the first invention of locks distinct from both
is equally uncertain; nor do I know of any positive mention
of a key, which, like our own, could be taken out of the lock,
previous to the year 1336 before our era; and this is stated
to have been used to fasten the door of the summer parlour of
Eglon, the king of Moab. The description here adverted to
is that contained in Judges iii. 23-25: ‘Ehud went forth
through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon
him, and locked them ... his servants ... took a key,
and opened them.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span></p>

<p>The curious and ingenious wooden lock of ancient Egypt
is still in use in Egypt and Turkey. In Eton’s <i>Survey of
the Turkish Empire</i>, published towards the close of the last
century, the locks then and there in use are thus described:
“Nothing can be more clumsy than the door-locks in Turkey;
but their mechanism to prevent picking is admirable.
It is a curious thing to see wooden locks upon iron doors,
particularly in Asia, and on their caravanserais and other
great buildings, as well as upon house-doors. The key
goes into the back part of the bolt, and is composed of a
square stick with five or six iron or wooden pins, about half
an inch long, towards the end of it, placed at irregular distances,
and answering to holes in the upper part of the bolt,
which is pierced with a square hole to receive the key. The
key being put in as far as it will go, is then lifted up; and
the pins, entering the corresponding holes, raise other pins
which had dropped into these holes from the part of the lock
immediately above, and which have heads to prevent them
falling lower than is necessary. The bolt, being thus freed
from the upper pins, is drawn back by means of the key; the
key is then lowered, and may be drawn out of the bolt. To
lock it again, the bolt is only pushed in, and the upper pins
fall into the holes in the bolt by their own weight.” Mr.
Eton, probably seeing how well the tumbler-principle is here
understood, says: “This idea might be improved on; but
the Turks never think of improving.” The locks on the
doors of modern houses in Cairo seem to be of this long-established
form, except where iron locks have been imported
from Europe.</p>

<p>A letter was inserted in the <i>Journal of Design</i> for July
1850 from Mr. W. C. Trevelyan; in which, after adverting to
the Egyptian lock, he says: “It is remarkable that the locks
which have been in use in the Faröe Islands, probably for
centuries, are identical in their construction with the Egyptian.
They are, lock and key, in all their parts made of
<i>wood</i>; of which material, if I mistake not, they have also<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
been found in Egyptian catacombs; and so identical with the
Faröese in structure and appearance, that it would not be
easy to distinguish one from the other.”</p>

<p>The construction of this remarkable Egyptian or pin-lock
will be understood from the accompanying engravings. The
quadrangular portion, <i>a a</i> <a href="#Fig1">fig. 1</a>, is the case of the lock, screwed
or otherwise fastened to the door, having a wooden bolt, <i>b b</i>,
passing horizontally through a cavity in it. In the part of the
case above the bolt are several small cells containing headed
pins, arranged in any desired form; and in the top of the bolt
itself are an equal number of holes similarly arranged. The
effect of this arrangement is such that, when brought into the
right positions, the lower ends of the headed pins drop into the
corresponding holes in the bolt, thereby fastening the bolt in
the lock-case. A large hollow, or cavity, is made at the exposed
end of the bolt, the cavity extending as far as and beyond
the holes occupied by the pins. The key consists of a
piece of wood (shewn in two positions, <a href="#Fig3">figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig4">4</a>,) having
pins arranged like those in the lock, and projecting upwards
just to a sufficient distance to reach the upper surface of the
bolt. This being the arrangement, whenever the key is introduced
and pressed upwards, its pins exactly fill the holes
in the bolt, and by so doing dislodge those which had fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
from the upper part of the case. The bolt may, under these
circumstances, be withdrawn (as shewn in <a href="#Fig2">fig. 2</a>), leaving the
headed pins elevated in their cells, instead of occupying the
position shewn by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig1">fig. 1</a>. The cavity in
the bolt must of course be high enough to receive the thickness
of the key, and also the length of the pins protruding
from the key.</p>

<p>This primitive lock comprises many of the best features of
the tumbler or lever-locks of later days, as will be seen in a
future chapter. There will also be opportunities of shewing
how the pin-action has been applied in other ways in some of
the modern locks.</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER III.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">LOCK CLASSIFICATION. THE PUZZLE-LOCK AND THE DIAL-LOCK.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">In approaching the subject of modern locks it becomes necessary
to decide upon some method of treating the widely-scattered
and diverse materials which are presented to our notice. One
plan would be to trace the subject chronologically, by describing,
in the order of their invention, the most important locks
which have been presented to public notice. But this would be
attended with some disadvantages: the peculiar characters of the
several locks would not be brought out with sufficient distinctness;
and the result, so far as the reader is concerned, would
rather tend to confusion than to a clear appreciation of the
subject. There are more advantages belonging to a classification
of locks under certain headings, according to some marked
peculiarities in their modes of action. This is a convenient
plan, but it is not an easy one to put in execution; for inventors
have not sought to place their locks in any particular
class, but rather to call attention to their merits. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
many locks embody two or three distinct principles so equally,
that it will often be difficult to decide in which class to place
them. This, nevertheless, may be done with an approach
to correctness. It is necessary first, however, to explain certain
technical terms by which locks are distinguished one from
another.</p>

<p>Locks, in truth, admit of an immense variety, which, however
important to be known to locksmiths, carpenters, and
others employed on them, need only be glanced at very cursorily
by the general reader. Some locks are named according
to the purposes to which they are to be applied; others
according to their shape, or the principles of their construction.
In the first place, there is the distinction between <i>in-door</i>
and <i>out-door</i> locks. Of in-door locks, one principal kind is the
<i>draw-back</i> lock, for street-doors, in which the bolt is capable of
maintaining any one of three positions: it may be locked by
the key, or left half-way out by the pressure of a spring, or be
drawn back by a handle. In the first position, it can only be
withdrawn by the key; in the second, it closes the door, but
can easily be withdrawn by the handle; and in the third, it
leaves the door unfastened. If these locks are made of iron
and carefully finished, they are further called <i>iron-rim</i>; but
if made of wood, suitable for back-doors and inferior purposes,
they are <i>spring-stock</i>. For the doors of rooms, there
are the <i>iron-rim</i>, the <i>brass-case</i>, and the <i>mortise</i> lock; the second
supplants the first, and the third the second, as we advance
in the elegance of the door-fittings. Other designations for
room-locks depend on the number of the bolts: thus, if there
be only one bolt, it is a <i>dead lock</i> or <i>closet lock</i>; if there be a
second bolt, urged by a spring and drawn back by a handle,
it is a <i>two-bolt lock</i>; and if there be also a third, a private
bolt acting only on one side of the door, it is a <i>three-bolt lock</i>.
Again, according to the kind of handle employed, it may be a
<i>knob lock</i> or a <i>ring lock</i>. According to which edge of the door
it is to be fixed, it becomes a <i>right-hand</i> or a <i>left-hand</i> lock.
If the wards of the lock are of somewhat superior quality, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
bend round nearly to a circle, the lock is <i>one-ward round</i>, <i>two-ward
round</i>, and so forth. If the lock has no wards at all, it
is <i>plain</i>; if the wards are of common character, they are often
called <i>wheels</i>, and then the lock becomes <i>one-wheel</i>, <i>two-wheel</i>,
&amp;c. Sometimes the lock is named from certain fancied resemblances
in the shape of the ward, as the L-<i>ward</i>, T-<i>ward</i>, or
Z-<i>ward</i>. If the wards are cast in brass, instead of being made
of slips of iron or copper, the lock is termed <i>solid ward</i>.</p>

<p>Of the numerous but smaller varieties known by the collective
name of <i>cabinet locks</i>, there are the <i>cupboard</i>, the <i>bookcase</i>,
the <i>desk</i>, the <i>portable desk</i>, the <i>table</i>, the <i>drawer</i>, the <i>box</i>,
the <i>caddy</i>, the <i>chest</i>, the <i>carpet-bag</i>, and many other locks. All
these locks are further called <i>straight</i>, when the plate is to be
screwed flat against the wood-work; <i>cut</i>, when the wood is to
be so cut away as to let in the lock flush with the surface;
and <i>mortise</i>, when a cavity is excavated in the edge of the door
for the reception of the lock.</p>

<p>Out-door locks are usually <i>wooden stock locks</i>, for stables,
gates, &amp;c.; comprising many varieties of <i>Banbury</i>, <i>bastard</i>, <i>fine</i>,
&amp;c. There are D <i>locks</i> and P <i>locks</i>, for gates, designated from
their shapes; and there are the numerous kinds of <i>padlocks</i>.</p>

<p>The above terms are employed chiefly between the makers
of the locks and the persons who fix them in their places; but
there are other terms and names, more familiarly known, which
will come under notice in future pages.</p>

<p>It is scarcely worth while to descant upon the “middle age”
of lock-making&mdash;to impart to the subject so much of dignity
as to be susceptible of regular historical treatment. True, we
know that <i>wards</i> were employed before <i>tumblers</i> (unless, indeed,
the pins of the Egyptian lock be considered as tumblers&mdash;a
character to which they present considerable claim), and
that wards may be taken as the representative of the medieval
period of lock-making; but it may be more profitable
to proceed in our notice of the different kinds of locks in
an order which will in itself partake somewhat of the historical
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span></p>

<p>Apart from all the warded and tumbler locks are the very
curious <i>puzzle</i> or <i>letter-locks</i>; a construction which we propose
to dismiss out of hand in the present chapter, before treating
of those which have more commercial importance.</p>

<p>The puzzle-lock is generally in the form of a padlock,
which is opened and closed without the use of a key, and
which has certain difficulties thrown in the way of its being
opened by any one who is not in the secret of the person who
closed it. It is, in fact, one of the locks in which the doctrine
of permutation is made to contribute to the means of security.
The key to open it is a <i>mnemonic</i> or <i>mental</i> one, instead of one
of steel or iron. Two centuries ago, the puzzle-lock attracted
far more attention than any other. It has always certain
movable parts, the movement of which constitutes the enigma.
Some of these very curious and out-of-the-way locks are so
formed as to receive the name of <i>dial-locks</i>; but the chief
among them are <i>ring-locks</i>&mdash;a name the meaning of which
will be presently understood.</p>

<p>The puzzle or letter-lock of the ring kind, then, consists
essentially of a spindle; a barrel, encompassing the spindle;
two end-pieces, to keep the spindle and barrel in their places;
and the shackle, hinged to one of these end-pieces. To unfasten
the lock, one of the end-pieces must be drawn out a
little, to allow the shackle or horse-shoe to be turned on its
hinge; and the question arises, therefore, how this end-piece
is to be acted upon. This is effected in a very ingenious way:
there are four studs or projections in a row on the spindle,
and as the spindle fits pretty closely in the barrel, the former
cannot be drawn out of the latter unless there be a groove in
the interior of the barrel, as a counterpart to the studs on the
exterior of the spindle; four rings fit on the barrel, on the
interior of each of which there is a groove; and unless all
these four grooves coincide in direction, and even lie in the
same plane as the groove in the barrel, the studs will not be
able to pass, and the spindle cannot be drawn out. Each ring
may be easily made to work round the barrel by means of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
fingers, and to maintain any position which may be given to
it. There are outer rings, one over each of the rings just
described, with the letters of the alphabet (or a considerable
number of them) inscribed on each; and these outer rings, by
means of notches on the inside, govern the movements of the
inner rings.</p>

<p>The action is, therefore, as follows: when the padlock is
to be locked, the rings are so adjusted that all the grooves
shall be in a right line; the spindle is thrust in, the end-piece
is fixed on, and the shackle is shut down. The padlock is now
fastened; but a reverse order of proceeding would as easily
open it again, and therefore the “safety” or “puzzle” principle
is brought into requisition. The outer rings are moved
with the finger, so as to throw the various interior grooves out
of a right line, and thus prevent the withdrawal of the spindle.
As each ring may be turned round through a large or a
small arc, and all turned in different degrees, the variations
of relative position may be almost infinite. The letters on the
outer rings are to assist the owner to remember the particular
combination which he had adopted in the act of locking; for
no other combination than this will suffice to open the lock.
There may, for instance, be the four letters <span class="smcapall">L O C K</span> in a line,
which line is brought to coincide with two notches or marks
at the ends of the apparatus; and until all the four outer
rings are again brought into such relative position as to place
the letters in a line, the lock cannot be opened.</p>

<p>There are many allusions to locks, apparently belonging to
the letter or puzzle principle, in authors who flourished two
or three centuries ago. Thus, in Beaumont and Fletcher’s
play of the <i>Noble Gentleman</i>, written in the early part of the
seventeenth century, one of the characters speaks of</p>

</div>

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>In the <i>Memorabilia</i> of Vanhagen von Ense, written about
the middle of the seventeenth century, a commendatory notice
is given of a letter-lock, or combination-lock, invented by M.
Regnier, Director of the <i>Musée d’Artillerie</i> at Paris. “Regnier,”
we are told, “was a man of some invention, and had taken out
a patent for a sort of lock, which made some noise at the time.
Every body praised his invention, and bought his locks. These
consisted of broad steel rings, four, five, or eight deep, upon
each of which the alphabet was engraved; these turned round
on a cylinder of steel, and only separated when the letters
forming a particular word were in a straight line with one
another. The word was selected from among a thousand, and
the choice was the secret of the purchaser. Any one not
knowing the word might turn the ring round for years without
succeeding in finding the right one. The workmanship
was excellent, and Regnier was prouder of this than of
the invention itself. The latter point might be contested.
I had a vague recollection of having seen something of the
sort before; but when I ventured to say so, my suspicions
were treated with scorn and indignation, and I was not able
to prove my assertion; but many years afterwards, when a
book, which as a boy I had often diligently read, fell into my
hands, Regnier’s lock was suddenly displayed. The book was
called <i>Silvestri a Petrasancta Symbola Heroica</i>, printed at Amsterdam
in 1682. There was an explanation at p. 254, attached
to a picture; these were the words:&mdash;<i>Honorius de
Bellis, serulæ innexæ orbibus volubilibus ac literatis circumscripsit
hoc lemma&mdash;Sorte aut labore</i>.<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> However, neither luck
nor labour would have done much more towards discovering
the secret of opening Regnier’s locks, from the variety of
their combinations; and their security seemed so great, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
the couriers’ despatch-boxes were generally fastened with
them.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote3"></a><a href="#FNanchor3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> “Honorius de Bellis wrote this inscription,&mdash;<i>By chance or by labour</i>,&mdash;round
a lock composed of revolving rings graven with letters.”</p>

</div>

<p>This curious extract, which was brought forward by Mr.
Chubb, in a paper on locks and keys (read before the Institution
of Civil Engineers in 1850), seems to take away the
credit from one (Regnier) with whose name the letter-lock
has been most intimately associated. We shall presently
explain, however, what it was that Regnier effected towards
perfecting the letter-lock. In the meantime it may be interesting
to note that the British Museum contains a copy of
the work mentioned by Vanhagen. At the page indicated
there is an engraving (a fac-simile of which is given in <a href="#Fig5">fig. 5</a>)
containing a drawing of a veritable puzzle or letter-lock; the
lock consists of a cylinder or barrel, on which seven rings
work; each of these rings is inscribed with letters, and the
ends of the cylinder are grasped by a kind of shackle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig5">
<img src="images/illo022.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 5. Puzzle-lock of the seventeenth century.</p>
</div>

<p>It was a natural result of the arrangement of the letter-lock,
as invented (conjecturally) by Cardan, that only one
particular word or cipher or key could be used in each lock;
and it was to increase the puzzle-power of the lock that Regnier<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
doubled all the rings, making each pair concentric, and
enabling the user to vary the cipher at pleasure.</p>

<p>The principle of the letter-lock, when applied to doors,
requires that sort of modification which renders it what is
termed a <i>dial-lock</i>. There are to such a lock one or more
dials, with a series of letters or figures stamped on them;
there is to each dial a hand or pointer connected by a spindle
with a wheel inside the lock; on the wheel is a notch which
has to be brought to a certain position before the bolt can
be moved. There are false notches, to add to the difficulty of
finding the true notch in each wheel. To adjust the notches
to their proper position, a nut on the back of the wheel is
loosened, and the pointer is set at any letter or figure chosen
by the user. The pointers and the dials perform the part of
the outer rings, the wheels that of the inner rings; and it is
easy to see that the same leading features prevail in the two
kinds of lock, however they may differ in detail.</p>

<p>These dial-locks have not been numerous; they require
wheel and pinion work within the body of the lock, which
gives delicacy and complication to the mechanism. The letter
padlock, be its merits great or small, is strong and durable,
not liable to get out of order; and in so far as it requires
no key or key-hole, it occupies rather a special position among
locks. One of our great “merchant-princes” has been a
letter-lock inventor, as the following will shew.</p>

<p>Early in 1852, Mr. William Brown, the distinguished
member for South Lancashire, read a paper before the Architectural
and Archæological Society of Liverpool, of much interest
in relation to our present subject. His object was to
describe a letter-lock which he had invented, and which had
up to that time given high satisfaction. We cannot do better
than transcribe the paper, as reported in one of the Liverpool
Journals, with a few abridgments.</p>

<p>“As your society are desirous of seeing any improvements
or attempts at them, I send you a stock-lock for inspection.
The idea for its construction I took from a letter-padlock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
I had a lock of this description made by Mr. Pooley twenty-five
years ago, which has been in use ever since on Brown,
Shipley, and Co.’s safe....</p>

<p>“Its advantages I conceive to be&mdash;First, it cannot be
picked, for there is no key-hole. Second, it cannot be blown
up by gunpowder, for the same reason. Third, you cannot
drill through the door so as to reach the lock, for you are
intercepted by a steel plate on which your tools will not act:
thus you cannot introduce gunpowder that way to force the
lock off. Fourth, you cannot bounce off the wheels in the interior
with a muffled hammer, for vulcanised India-rubber
springs resist this. Fifth, you cannot drill the spindles out,
as their heads are case-hardened. Sixth, you cannot drive
them in, for they are countersunk in the door about half-way
through....</p>

<p>“Now let us set the lock to the word <span class="smcapall">W O O D</span> (any other
four letters might be used). When you set the lock, make
a private record of them, so that you may not forget them.
If parties do not know your letters, nothing but violence,
applied by some means or other, can enable them to get into
your safe; for the lock will not open to any thing but its
talisman. Take off all the large wheels and open the lock:
you will see that the large wheels have a number of false
chambers; if you get the spurs of the bolt into three real
chambers and one false, you are as fast as ever, for all four
must be right.</p>

<p>“Having placed your key and pointer outside the door to
point to <span class="smcapall">W</span> on brass-plate No. 1, the small wheel inside obeys
the same impulse; then maintain your small wheel steadily
on this point, and the large wheel No. 1 will only fit on at
the right place, the true opening compartment being opposite
the spur of the bolt. It being necessary at the time you set
your lock that it should be open, proceed with Nos. 2 and 3
in the same way, your pointer standing steadily at <span class="smcapall">O</span>. No. 4
is the same, the pointer being held steadily at <span class="smcapall">D</span>. You should
then shoot your lock two or three times, to be sure you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
made no mistake. Every time you shoot your bolts out, turn
your wheels away from the true chamber, and see when you
again turn your pointers to <span class="smcapall">W O O D</span> that your lock opens freely;
it is the proof that you have made no mistake, and you
may now venture to lock your safe. When you unlock the
door, and find it necessary to leave it open for a time, you
should shoot the bolts as if locked, and turn the wheels, so
that no one may find what your real letters are; and again
adjust them to their proper places, in order that the bolt may
go back and enable you to re-lock. Once having locked the
door and turned the wheels from your real letters, you need
not trouble yourself with carrying the key, but leave it in
any place beside the lock.</p>

<p>“I believe two wheels would make a perfectly safe lock;
three would be quite so. I adopted four to make security
doubly sure, as it would be impossible in any given time to
work the changes. On two wheels by chance the lock might
open; you can, however, calculate the chances against this;
and also three or four, the false compartment on the outer
rim being taken into calculation.
<span class="padl5 padr5">*</span><span class="padl5 padr5">*</span><span class="padl5">*</span></p>

<p>“If this lock is of any value, it should be known; if it
has weak points, let them be pointed out, and they may admit
of a remedy; for we ought not to be led to believe a lock is
safe which is not so.”</p>

<p>In relation to the “first advantage” which Mr. Brown not
unreasonably supposed to be possessed by his lock&mdash;viz. that
“it cannot be picked, because it has no keyhole”&mdash;we shall
have something to say in a future page, where certain fallacies
on this subject will be noticed. In the meantime we
may remark, that it is not a little creditable that a leading
Liverpool merchant should have invented a lock worthy of
occupying a position on his own safe for a quarter of a
century; for we may be quite certain that he would not have
allowed the lock to maintain that post of honour unless it had
really (so far as experience had then gone) served worthily
as a safeguard to his treasures. And if it were possible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
collect all the by-gone specimens of lock-oddities, we should
probably find among them many highly-ingenious letter-locks;
for supposing a man to have a mechanical turn of mind, a
lock is by no means an unworthy medium for displaying it;
the pieces of metal are so small as to be easily manageable
at a small work-bench in a small room. The fondness for
this sort of employment evinced by the unfortunate Louis XVI.
of France led to the common remark, “He is a capital locksmith,
but a very bad king.”</p>

<p>In an amusing article in the <i>Observer</i>, during the progress
of the “lock controversy,” was the following paragraph relating
to combination-locks of the letter or puzzle kind: “The
French, in their exposition of 1844, availing themselves of the
permutation principle, produced some marvels in the art;
but the principle has not been adopted in this country. The
<i>Charivari</i> had an amusing quiz upon these locks when they
first came out. It said the proprietor of such a lock must
have an excellent memory: forget the letters, and you are
clearly shut out from your own house. For instance, a gentleman
gets to his door with his family, after a country excursion,
at eleven o’clock at night, in the midst of a perfect deluge of
rain. He hunts out his alphabetical key, and thrusts it into
his alphabetical lock, and says <span class="smcapall">A Z B X</span>. The lock remains as
firm as ever. ‘Plague take it!’ says the worthy citizen, as
the blinding rain drives in his eyes. He then recollects that
that was his combination for the previous day. He scratches
his head to facilitate the movement of his intellectual faculties,
and makes a random guess <span class="smcapall">B C L O</span>; but he has no better success.
In addition to his being well wet, his chances of hitting
on the right combinations and permutations are but small,
seeing that the number is somewhere about three millions five
hundred and fifty-three thousand five hundred and seventy-eight.
Accordingly, when he comes to the three-hundredth
he loses all patience, and begins to kick and batter the door;
but a patrol of the National Guard passes by, and the disturber
of the streets is marched off to the watch-house.”</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER IV.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">WARDED LOCKS, WITH THEIR VARIED APPENDAGES.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The more ordinary locks are of an oblong quadrangular shape.
In nearly all of them, either a bolt shoots out from the lock,
to catch into some kind of staple or box, or a staple enters a
hole in the edge of the lock, and is there acted upon by the bolt.
A common room-door lock will illustrate the first of these
kinds, a tea-caddy lock the second. The key, as is well known,
enters a receptacle made for it; and the shaft of the key generally
serves as a pivot or axis around which the web or flat
part of the key may move in a circular course. During this
movement the web acts directly or indirectly on the bolt,
driving it in or out according to the direction in which the
key is turned; the key impels the bolt one way, certain
springs act upon it in another, and the balance between these
two forces determines the locking and unlocking of the bolt.
<i>Wards</i>, or <i>wheels</i>, are contrivances for rendering the opening
difficult without the proper key; and it is of warded locks that
we shall chiefly treat in this chapter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig6">
<img src="images/illo027.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 6. Interior of a back-spring warded lock.</p>
</div>

<p>The annexed cut, <a href="#Fig6">fig. 6</a>, represents the interior of an ordinary
back-spring lock, without tumblers. Such a lock may<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
usually be known from a tumbler-lock by this simple circumstance,
that it emits a smart snapping noise during the process
of locking, occasioned by the pressure of the spring when the
bolt is in a particular position. In the woodcut the bolt is
represented half out, or half shot. At <i>a a</i> are two notches on
the under side of the bolt connected by a curved part; <i>b</i> is the
back spring, which becomes compressed by the passage of the
curve through a limited aperture in the rim <i>c c</i> of the lock.
When the bolt is wholly withdrawn, one of the notches <i>a</i> rests
upon the rim <i>c c</i>; and the force with which the notch falls
into this position, urged by the spring <i>b</i>, gives rise to the
snapping or clicking noise. When the bolt is wholly shot,
the other notch rests in like manner upon the edge of the aperture
in the rim.</p>

<p>It must be obvious at a glance, that this back-spring lock
is objectionable on the score of security, on account of the
facility with which the bolt may be forced back by any pressure
applied to its end, a pressure which may often easily be
brought to bear. At the centre of the lock is seen the end of
the key acting on a notch in the bolt, and surrounded by
wards.</p>

<p class="caption">fig. 7. Section to shew the action of wards.</p>
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>It is not at a first glance that the relation between the
clefts in a key and the wards of a lock can be duly appreciated;
because the wards present themselves to view as portions
of circles to which nothing in the key seems to correspond;
but if it be borne in mind that the key has a rotary<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
motion within the key-hole around the pipe or barrel as an
axis, the circular form of the wards will be accounted for, and
their <i>section</i> will be regarded as exhibiting the looked-for
relation to the wards of the key. In the annexed cut, for
example (<a href="#Fig7">fig. 7</a>), which represents a portion of the interior of a
warded lock, the curved pieces of metal are the wards (two in
this case); and there are two clefts in the bitt of the key to
enable the latter to take its circular course without interruption
from the wards. If the clefts were other than they are, either
in number, position, or size, this freedom of the key’s movement
could not be obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig8">
<img src="images/illo029.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 8. End sections of keys.</p>
</div>

<p>When once the opinion became established that a lock is
rendered secure by virtue of its wards, (a theory which we
shall have to discuss in a later page,) much ingenuity was displayed
in varying the wards of the lock, the clefts of the key,
and the shape of the keyhole. Even if the two former were
unchanged, a change in the latter might add to the puzzlement
of the arrangement. For instance, in the annexed cut
(fig. 8), all the six keys represented may have clefts or cuts
exactly alike, all alike adapted to the wards of one particular
lock; yet the differences in the <i>thickness</i> of the web are such,
that if the keyholes were shaped in conformity therewith, each
keyhole would be entered by one of these keys; <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> differing
from <i>a</i> in the relative thickness at different points, and
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>f</i> having certain curvatures and cavities not to be
found in the other three.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig9">
<img src="images/illo030.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 9. Examples to shew the action of “master,” or “skeleton keys.”</p>
</div>

<p>But without waiting for the detailed examination of the relative
security and insecurity of locks, we may at once shew
how simple is the principle which renders the warded system<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
fallacious. In <a href="#Fig9">fig. 9</a> we shall be able to illustrate this.
Numbers 1, 2, and 3, all appear very different keys, and it is
quite true that neither one would open a lock adapted for
either of the other two; and yet the very simple arrangement
No. 4 would open all three. This No. 4 is called a <i>skeleton-key</i>;
and the relation which it bears to the others may be expressed
in the form of a proposition thus: at any point where
there is solid metal in <i>all</i> the keys, there must (or may) be
solid metal in the corresponding part of the skeleton-key; but
at any point where there is a vacancy or cavity in <i>any</i> of the
keys, there must be a cavity in the corresponding part of the
skeleton-key. If Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, be examined, this proposition
will be found to be borne out; there is so much cavity
in No. 4 that it avoids the wards in all the three locks, nothing
being required but the tongue of metal to move the bolt.
Sometimes, to add to the safety, wards are attached to the
front as well as the back plate of the lock; and then there may
be a double series of notches required in the key, such as in
No. 5; but if this be compared with Nos. 9, 10, 11, it will be
found that although no one of the four would open a lock<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
adapted for either of the other three, yet the skeleton-key No.
12 would master them all, having cavities wherever any of the
others have cavities. This is the theory of the <i>master-key</i>, by
which one key may be made to command many locks. Nos.
6 and 7 have complicated wards; but the key is so much cut
up as to be weakened more than is desirable. No. 8 enables
us to point out the difference between two distinct classes of
keys. Keys with pipes or barrels fitting on a pin or pipe-shaft
can only open a lock on one side of the door or box;
but a key with a solid stem, as No. 8, has the clefts so cut as
to open the lock from either side, as in a street-door lock: it is,
in fact, two warded keys fixed end to end, only half of which
is employed at one time in opening the lock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig10">

<p class="caption">fig. 10. Wards of an old French lock.</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the warded locks of the last century are curious.
While the idea prevailed that a complicated ward gave security,
there was room for the exercise of ingenuity in varying
the shape of the wards. <a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a> is copied from the great
French work. It represents the cuts in the key, and also
(seen perspectively) the complicated forms of the pieces of
metal which constitute the wards corresponding with those
cuts. The aperture in the key at 16 fits upon the metal
surrounding the keyhole at 18; and the M-shaped cuts at
17 fit in like manner upon the similarly-shaped metal pieces
at 19.</p>

<p>Another example of a similar kind is shewn in <a href="#Fig11">fig. 11</a>,
where an anchor appears to have been the favourite form. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
anchor cuts in the key are shewn at 26; while in the wards
the bottom of the anchor is near the keyhole at 28, and the top
at 29.</p>

<p>From the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries locks were
made in France, on which a vast amount of care and expense
was bestowed. They were, in an especial degree,
decorative appendages as well as fastenings. They were of
three kinds: room-locks, buffet-locks, and chest-locks; they
were fixed on the outside of the door or lid, so as to be fully
visible. The key had a multitude of perforations which bore
no particular relation to the wards of the lock, but which were
regarded as tests of the workman’s skill. The honorary distinctions
awarded to apprentices and aspirants in the art depended
very much on the number and fine execution of these
perforated keys. The locks, considered as fastenings, had
slender merit; although usually throwing four bolts, they were
not very secure. <a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a> represents the exterior of a lock
made about the year 1730, by Bridou, a celebrated Parisian
locksmith. It was a lock belonging to a coffer or strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
chest; all the works being sunk below the level of a carved
architectural moulding or ornament. There is a secret opening
near the part <span class="smcapall">C</span>, forming a portion of the ornamental design;
it allows a bolt, shewn at <span class="smcapall">D</span>, <a href="#Fig14">fig. 14</a>, acted on by the
spring <span class="smcapall">E</span>, to be touched, by which a doorway opens upon the
hinges at <span class="smcapall">B B</span>. <span class="smcapall">A A</span> are a sort of pilasters, which aid in forming
a hold for the bolts. The little ornament at <span class="smcapall">C</span> is drawn down
by the hand, opening the secret door and revealing the key-hole
<span class="smcapall">G</span>. <span class="smcapall">S S</span>, <span class="smcapall">O O</span>,
<span class="smcapall">Z Z</span>, are ornaments fastened on at <i>b c d</i>, <a href="#Fig14">fig. 14</a>,
by nuts and screws, intended to display the skill of the workman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
The lock itself, access to the keyhole of which is obtained
within the secret door, has nothing very remarkable
about it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig15">
<img src="images/illo034.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 15. Examples of true and false keys.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Chubb, in his paper read before the Institute of Civil
Engineers, illustrated the insecurity of the warded lock by the
example of one which had actually been placed in the strong-room
of a banking house, and which is represented in the
annexed cut (<a href="#Fig15">fig. 15</a>). The wards are here shewn, surrounding
the central key-pin; and from the appearance of the key,
shewn at <i>a</i>, it is evident that these wards must have been
rather complex. But the uselessness of the wards was proved
by the result. A burglar employed an instrument, shaped like
that at <i>b</i>, having on one of its faces, or sides, a layer of wax
and yellow soap; this instrument, being introduced through
the keyhole and turned a little way round, brought the soft
composition in contact with the ends of the wards, and these
ends thus left their impress on the composition. A false key
was then made, as at <i>c</i>, which, however clumsy it may appear,
has a cavity, or vacuity, where there is a cavity in the true
key; and by such a surreptitious instrument was the lock
opened. Even so rude an instrument as <i>d</i>, by passing round
the wards, might open such a lock.</p>

<p>We are somewhat anticipating the full consideration of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
subject; but it is desirable at once to explain how and why
an improvement on the warded lock was sought for.</p>

<p>In connexion with the fanciful eighteenth-century locks,
lately adverted to, we may remark, that no less a man than
Louis XVI. was an amateur workman in this department of
mechanical art&mdash;or at least in smith’s work, which in France
is generally considered to include lock-making. Sir Archibald
Alison says, in his <i>History of Europe</i>:&mdash;“He had an
extraordinary fondness for athletic occupation and mechanical
labour; insomuch that he frequently worked several hours
a-day with a blacksmith of the name of Gamin, who taught
him the art of wielding the hammer and managing the forge.
He took the greatest interest in this occupation, and loaded
his preceptor in the art with kindness; who returned it by
betraying to the Convention a secret iron recess which they
had together worked out in the walls of the cabinet in the
Tuileries, wherein to deposit his secret papers during the
storms of the Revolution.” There are not wanting indications
that the unfortunate monarch wrought upon locks, as
well as upon safes and strong-rooms.</p>

<p>Besides wards, there have been numerous other contrivances
for adding to the security of locks&mdash;including screws,
escutcheons, spiral springs, wheel-and-pinion work, alarums,
and multiple bolts. As these are not of sufficient importance
to be treated in separate chapters, we shall here give just
so much notice of them as will illustrate their general character.
Some of them are found combined with the “tumbler”
principle, presently to be described; but all of them, it is now
well known, were employed in various, ways when the tumbler
lock was but little understood, and when the warded lock was
held in esteem.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Worcester, whose curious <i>Century of Inventions</i>,
written nearly two hundred years ago, contains so
many suggestions which ingenuity has since developed into
practical completeness, gives four of his inventions in the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span></p>

<p>69. “A way how a little triangle screwed key, not weighing
a shilling, shall be capable and strong enough to bolt and
unbolt, round about a great chest, an hundred bolts, through
fifty staples, two in each, with a direct contrary motion; and
as many more from both sides and ends; and, at the self-same
time, shall fasten it to the place beyond a man’s natural
strength to take it away; and in one and the same turn both
locketh and openeth it.</p>

<p>70. “A key with a rose-turning pipe and two roses pierced
through endwise the bit thereof, with several handsomely contrived
wards, which may likewise do the same effects.</p>

<p>71. “A key, perfectly square, with a screw turning within
it, and more conceited than any of the rest, and no heavier
than the triangle screwed key, and doth the same effects.</p>

<p>72. “An escutcheon, to be placed before any of these locks,
with these properties: First, the owner, though a woman, may
with her delicate hand vary the ways of causing to open the
lock ten millions of times beyond the knowledge of the smith
that made it, or of me that invented it. Second, if a stranger
open it, it setteth an alarum a-going, which the stranger cannot
stop from running out; and besides, though none shall be
within hearing, yet it catcheth his hand as a trap doth a fox;
and though far from maiming him, yet it leaveth such a mark
behind it as will discover him if suspected; the escutcheon or
lock plainly shewing what money he hath taken out of the
box to a farthing, and how many times opened since the owner
had been at it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Partington, in his edition of the marquis’s singular
work, makes a few comments on these lock-and-key contrivances.
He says that the lock is evidently intended to operate
on the principle of applying a <i>screw</i> for the purpose of moving
the bolt, instead of using a key as a lever for this purpose.
That such a plan might be applied to locks generally, he
observes, there can be no doubt; and by a similar contrivance
the large keys at present in use for outer doors, iron chests,
&amp;c. might be advantageously reduced by this means. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
employing the escutcheon mentioned by the marquis, much
additional security would be obtained. It must be confessed,
however, that many of the marquis’s statements are difficult
to credit.</p>

<p>The escutcheon has been a favourite resource with lock-makers.
Mr. Mordan’s escutcheon, for instance, introduced
before the Society of Arts in 1830, is a contrivance to be
placed temporarily over the keyhole of a door, to prevent
the picking of the lock during the owner’s absence. The
escutcheon, or “protector,” has a short pipe which, after the
door has been locked, is thrust into the keyhole; attached to
the pipe is a small lock, on Bramah’s or any other convenient
principle, so contrived that, on turning its key, two lancet-shaped
pieces fly out laterally and bury themselves in the
wood. The escutcheon cannot be removed until the small
key has reacted upon the small lock; and until this removal
has taken place, the large key cannot reach the keyhole.</p>

<p>A curious application of the escutcheon principle attracted
some attention among locksmiths about seventy years ago.
One of the first premiums awarded by the Society of Arts,
after the commencement of their “Transactions,” was to Mr.
Marshall, for a “secret escutcheon,” in 1784. In his description
of his new invention, he adverts to the marquis of Worcester’s
wonderful escutcheon, and to the many attempts which
have since been made to produce an apparatus which should
realise the marquis’s description. He supposes that the letter
padlock originated as one among many varieties of these imitative
inventions; but this may be doubted. Mr. Marshall’s
contrivance, however, was in effect an endeavour to improve
upon the letter-lock. He considered it an objection that, in
ordinary locks of this kind, the letter-rings admit of no variation
of place; and he sought to remedy this defect. It is
not so much a new lock, as an escutcheon for a lock, which
he produced. There is a studded bar passing through a barrel;
there are five rings which work concentrically on this
barrel; there are letters on the outer surfaces of the rings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
and notches on the inner surface; but when, by the usual
puzzle-action of the rings, the notches in them have been
brought into a right line with the studs of the bar, the result
is, not that the hasp of a padlock is raised, but that the
escutcheon is removed from the keyhole of an ordinary lock.
Mr. Marshall’s contrivance, therefore, is not so much a ring padlock,
as a puzzle-ring security for the escutcheon of a fixed lock.</p>

<p>Some locks work by a screw and a spiral spring, instead
of an ordinary key. Mr. W. Russell received a silver medal
from the Society of Arts, about thirty years ago, for a new
mode of locking the cocks of liquor-casks. Under ordinary
circumstances, as is well known, the cock of a barrel or cask
is in no way secure from the action of any one who can
approach near enough to touch it; and different methods have
been adopted of obtaining this security or secrecy. One plan
is to employ a perforated cap, soft-soldered to the barrel of the
cock, immediately over the grooved plug, the top of which plug
is formed to the shape of the perforation, and a socket-key of
the same form is introduced to turn the plug or open the lock.
Another plan is to employ an iron saddle or staple, passing
over the plug and below the bottom of the cock, through
which a bolt is put, and a pendent padlock attached. The
first method is very inefficient; the second is much superior,
and has been largely adopted for locking the cocks of coppers,
stills, vats, and other large vessels. But Mr. Russell thought
some further improvement wanted. He caused a hole to be
bored through the barrel, and to some depth into the plug
when the latter is in the position for closing the cock. A
stud works into this hole in such a way, that when the stud
is driven home, the plug cannot be turned or the lock opened.
The stud is attached at its other end to a spiral spring connected
with a screw; a key is employed, the hollow pipe of
which has an internal screw; and when this key is inserted
in the cock-barrel and turned twice round, it draws back the
stud, and allows the plug to be turned round in the proper
way for opening the cock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span></p>

<p>It is not often that wheel-and-pinion work is introduced
into locks; the delicacy, the costliness, the weakness, and the
tendency to get out of order, would all militate against the
frequent adoption of such a course. It is, however, adopted
occasionally. Mr. Friend’s secret-lock, introduced to the notice
of the Society of Arts in 1825, had a train of wheels
which acted upon the bolt, driving it out whenever the circular
arcs of three wheels moved against it, but allowing a spring
to force it back again whenever a deep cleft in each of the
wheels locked into a stud on the bolt. There were certain
numbers on a guide-plate, and a power of combining these
numbers in great variety; and a provision that the bolt could
be unlocked only by the same combination of numbers which
had locked it. The guide-plate was a separate piece of apparatus,
carried in the pocket of the user as a companion to
the key. The key was of no use without the guide-plate,
nor the guide-plate without the key. The user ‘set’ the
numbers on the guide-plate, then applied it to the face of the
lock, then introduced the key into the key-hole, and turned
the key partially round; the bolt was now shot, and the guide-plate
removed. If the key were used without the guide-plate,
the bolt might be locked, but it was always unlocked again
by the time the key had made a complete circuit. There was
considerable ingenuity in the idea of this lock; but we believe
it never went further than a model. Indeed many of the locks
elaborately described in books have never had an existence as
acting working locks.</p>

<p>A very ingenious principle has been occasionally introduced,
in which clock-work regulates the interval of time
which must elapse before a lock can be opened, even with its
proper key. The object is, to ensure the safety of the lock
during a journey, or until a particular person be present, or
until the locked article is conveyed to a particular room.
A patent was taken out in 1831 for a lock on this principle
by Mr. Rutherford, a bank agent at Jedburgh. Against the
end of the bolt of the lock is placed a circular stop-plate, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
adjusted that the bolt cannot be withdrawn until a particular
notch in the rim of the circular plate is opposite the end of
the bolt. The plate is put in rotation by clock-work. As
the notch can be set at pleasure to any required distance from
the end of the bolt, the lock may be secured against being
opened, either by its own or any other key, until any assigned
number of minutes or hours after it has been locked;
for the plate may be made to revolve either slowly or quickly,
by varying the number of wheels in the clockwork. When
the lock is used for boxes or portable packages, the clockwork
must be moved and regulated by a spring; but when it is
applied to closets or safes, a descending weight and a pendulum
may be employed. It is manifest that this system is susceptible
of being greatly varied in its mode of application;
and it has many points of interest about it. That a man
cannot open his own lock with his own proper key, until the
lock gives permission by assuming a particular state or condition,
certainly strikes one as being susceptible of many useful
applications, where <i>time</i> is an element taken into the account.</p>

<p>A curious alarum-lock was invented by Mr. Meighan, in
1836, in which the bell or alarum is not placed behind a
door, as in many alarum contrivances, but within the lock
itself. Two or more studs are placed on the bolt, which press
against the lower end of a small tumbler; the movement of
the tumbler elevates a hammer; but as soon as the point of
the tumbler becomes released from the stud, a spring presses
the hammer down forcibly, and causes it to strike against a
small bell placed near it. This sounding of the bell will be
repeated, during the shutting of the bolt, as many times as
there are studs to act upon the point of the tumbler.</p>

<p>Much of the ingenuity which has been displayed in locks
depends on the employment of multiple bolts, there being all
the additional strength which results from the use of two or
more bolts instead of simply one. Ordinary doors seldom
afford us examples of these double bolts; but they may be frequently
seen in cabinets and desks, where two staples fixed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
the lid fall into two holes in the lock, and are retained by two
bolts. The most remarkable and complicated varieties, however,
are those in which the bolts, instead of shooting parallel
and nearly together, shoot in wholly different ways; one up,
one down, one to the right, one to the left, and so on. It is
on safes, strong boxes, and the doors of strong rooms containing
valuable treasures, that such locks are usually placed.
The mechanism is such that the key acts upon all the bolts
at once, through the intervention of levers and springs of
various kinds.</p>

<p class="caption">fig. 16. Multiple bolts of an old chest-lock.</p>
</div>

<p>The above <a href="#Fig16">woodcut</a> represents a very curious specimen
of these multiple-bolt locks. It is copied from the great French
work; and the ponderous chest to which it is attached is, we
are told by Réaumur, “known at Paris by the name of the
strong German coffer.” He further says, “nothing is wanting
in these coffers on the score of solidity. They are made
entirely of iron; or if of wood, they are banded both within
and without with iron; and can only be broken open by very<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
great violence. Their locks are almost as large as the top of
the coffer, and close with a great number of bolts. The one
which we have engraved has twelve fastenings; they have been
made with twenty-four, or more.” His next remark on the
subject is a sensible one: “Notwithstanding the large size of
these locks, and all the apparatus with which they are provided,
they correspond but ill with the solidity of the rest of
the coffer. If we have given a representation of one, it is
chiefly to shew how little confidence one could have in such
a lock, and what are its defects, in order that we may avoid
them.” It is not difficult, by tracing the action of the several
levers, to see how one movement of the key, in the centre of
the lid, would act upon all the bolts. In the engraving (<a href="#Fig16">fig. 16</a>)
<i>a</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>c</i>, are the four corner bolts; six others, <i>a d e</i>, <i>a d e</i>, are on
the long sides, three on each; and two, <i>b g</i>, on the short sides.
Every bolt is provided with a spring, of which three or four
are shewn at <span class="smcapall">Z Z Z</span>. There is no staple or box to receive
each bolt; but all shoot or snap beneath the raised edge <span class="smcapall">E</span>
running round the top of the box just within the exterior at
<span class="smcapall">A A</span>. The keyhole in the front of the box at <span class="smcapall">D</span> is a deception
or mask; the real keyhole is in the middle of the lid concealed
by a secret door opened by a spring. When the key has
moved the great central bolt, this acts upon the other bolts
<span class="smcapall">P Q R S T</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="smcapall">V V</span> are studs which act upon two of the bolts;
<span class="smcapall">Y Y</span> are staples confining the great bolt; <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>x</i>, are small
levers which transmit the action to the corner bolts; <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>n</i>,
are the small levers which render a similar service to the side
and end bolts; <span class="smcapall">L L</span> within the chest, and <span class="smcapall">M M</span> on the lid, are
contrivances for limiting the movement of the latter; <span class="smcapall">C H</span>, <span class="smcapall">H C</span>
are iron straps or bands by which the interior of the chest is
strengthened. After all, this is not so much a lock as a series
of spring latches.</p>

<p>If a lock can be picked, the picking is as effective whether
the lock has one bolt or twelve bolts. This fact led Mr. Duce,
in 1824, to construct, instead of a four-bolt lock, four distinct
one-bolt locks, fixed in the same frame and opened by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
same key; the bolts to be moved in succession instead of
simultaneously. It would require four times as long to pick
this as a four-bolt lock of similar action.</p>

<p>There have been many other varieties of the multiple bolt,
but we need not stop to describe them.</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER V.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">ON TUMBLER, OR LEVER LOCKS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">Security being the primary object in all locks, any considerations
as to mechanical ingenuity and graceful decoration
give place to those which relate to safety. A spring lock
may be ingenious and even beautiful in its construction, but
an imitative key will easily open it. Hence arose the invention
of wheels or wards; and as wards failed in trustworthiness,
they in their turn yielded to something better. We have
already explained how the insecurity of mere warded locks
arises; and we shall have something more to say on the subject
in a future chapter. It is sufficient here to remark, that wards,
springs, screws, alarums, wheel-work, escutcheons,&mdash;all, however
useful for particular purposes, are wanting in the degree
of surety which we require in a lock. Hence the invention of
<i>tumblers</i>, <i>levers</i>, or <i>latches</i>, which fall into the bolt and prevent
it from being shot until they have been raised or released by
the action of the key. We have been unable to ascertain at
what time, or in what country, or by whom, tumbler-locks
were invented. The invention has been claimed by or for
persons subsequently to the year 1767, when the celebrated
French treatise (<i>Art du Serrurier</i>) already referred to was
published; and yet this treatise contains numerous examples
of simple tumbler locks of ingenious construction, as will presently
be shewn.</p>

<p class="caption">fig. 17. Simple tumbler lock.</p>
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>One of the most elementary forms of tumbler-lock is shewn
in <a href="#Fig17">fig. 17</a>. In this case the bolt, instead of having two notches
in the bottom edge, like those in the back-spring lock, <a href="#Fig6">fig. 6</a>,
has two square notches or slots in the upper edge; and as the
key acts upon the bolt, these notches must of course share in
whatever movements the bolt is subjected to. Behind the bolt
is a kind of latch or tumbler (the lower part of which is shewn
by dotted lines), with a stump or projecting piece of metal at <i>a</i>;
the tumbler moves freely on a pivot at the other end, and is
made to rise through a small arc whenever the key acts upon
the bolt. When the bolt is wholly shot, the stump falls into
one notch and prevents the motion of the bolt; when wholly unshot
or withdrawn, the stump falls into the other notch, and
equally prevents the motion of the bolt. It is not, therefore,
until the key, by elevating the tumbler, has raised the stump
out of the notch, that the bolt has freedom of movement. If
the shape of the key does not enable its web to effect this
elevation to a sufficient degree, the bolt remains immovable;
and to this extent a certain additional security is obtained by
making the shape of the key significant as well as the wards.</p>

<p class="allclear">The tumbler-principle, as we have said, is difficult to trace
to its origin on account of the various aspects which it presents;
but the great French treatise proves that the locksmiths
of France were familiar with tumbler-locks a century ago.
The plates of that work represent the details of numerous
locks, on the upper edge of the bolts of which were notches
called <i>encoches</i>, as at <i>o k</i> <a href="#Fig18">fig. 18</a>; into these notches sank a<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
small iron stud or stump called the <i>arrêt du pêne</i>, or bolt-stop,
shewn in <a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>, attached to the upper portion of the <i>gâchette</i>
or tumbler, which, for the sake of economy of metal, is made
in the form of a triangular spring in front of the bolt <i>k i</i>;
and not until the key, by
its circular action, had raised
this stud out of one or
other of the notches, could
the bolt move to the right
or left. The stud was generally fixed to a spring which
forced it down again into the notch as soon as the action
of the key had ceased. Sometimes, however, the stud was
fixed to the bolt, and the notches were in a separate tumbler
or <i>gâchette</i> (see <span class="smcapall">E E</span>, <a href="#Fig21">fig. 21</a>); and in other instances, again,
the stump was fixed to the case of the lock and caught
into notches in the bolt. It will be seen, when we come to
treat of tumbler-locks of later date, that there was much
in these early locks to point out the way. <a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>, copied
from the French work, represents a lock of the box or casket
kind. Two staples, fixed into the cover, fall into two cavities
or receptacles at <span class="smcapall">C</span> <i>d</i>; and a short bolt in each receptacle
catches into each staple, one near <i>g</i> and one near <i>h</i>. The
small bolt <i>q</i> is attached to the upper extremity of the lever
<i>q r s</i>, <a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>, and shewn separately in <a href="#Fig20">fig. 20</a>; and by the
pressure of a spring <i>a</i> (<a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>)
upon this lever, the bolt<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
<i>q</i> is kept locked in the staple. The vertical portion
of this spring presses at its lower end on
another spring <i>p</i> (<a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>) of singular curvature;
and attached to the horizontal part of this second
spring is the stud, which falls into a notch in the
top of the bolt. The action of these parts, then,
is as follows: when the key is placed upon the
key-pin at <span class="smcapall">Z</span>, and turned round in the direction in
which the hands of a watch move, the bitt presses
against the tail <i>s</i> of the lever, moves it upon its
centre <span class="smcapall">Z</span>, <a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>, <i>v</i>, <a href="#Fig20">fig. 20</a>, to the left, and consequently
moves the upper part <i>q</i> to the right,
drawing it out of the receptacle and liberating the
staple within <span class="smcapall">C</span>. Thus it will be seen that the lever
<i>q r s</i>, held in one position by the spring <i>a</i>, forms in itself a
simple kind of spring catch-lock, and was, in fact, formerly used
as such, without any other appendages except the staple in
the lever, into which the catch <i>q</i> fitted on shutting down the
lid. So also we may regard the other portion, <a href="#Fig18">fig. 18</a>, or <i>k i p h</i>
(<a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>), as forming a separate lock; for the key after having
passed <span class="smcapall">S</span> comes in contact with the triangular spring, which it
raises thereby, lifting the stud out of the bolt, and exerting
pressure against the barbs of the bolt <i>n</i>. <a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a> shoots the
bolt <i>k</i>, and also the short bolt <i>l</i>, which passes through the
staple in the cavity <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The lock represented in the four following figures is also
from M. de Réaumur’s chapter on locks in the work referred
to. In this lock the tumbler-principle is carried out in a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
elaborate manner, for not only is the stump or stud <span class="smcapall">H</span> (<a href="#Fig23">fig. 23</a>)
attached to a very strong spring (best shewn at <span class="smcapall">H</span>, <a href="#Fig22">fig. 22</a>),
which holds it with considerable force in one of the three
notches of the principal bolt <span class="smcapall">R S</span> (<a href="#Fig24">fig. 24</a>); but there is also a
second set of notches <span class="smcapall">E E</span> in the <i>gâchette</i> <span class="smcapall">G O</span> (<a href="#Fig21">fig. 21</a>), and a pin
attached to one of the plates of the lock fits into one of these
notches, thereby preventing the bolt from being moved until
the <i>gâchette</i> is lowered by the revolution of the key; so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
in attempting to pick this lock, not only must the spring <span class="smcapall">H</span> be
raised so as to release the stud from the notches of the great
bolt, but the <i>gâchette</i> must be lowered to disengage the fixed
pin from the notches. There is yet a third source of security.
Attached to the large bolt are short projecting pins <span class="smcapall">F</span> (<a href="#Fig21">fig. 21</a>),
against which an arm or detent, <span class="smcapall">G F</span>, of the <i>gâchette</i> projects, thus
preventing the bolt from being shot back by any pressure
applied to its extremity <span class="smcapall">S</span>.</p>

<p class="caption">fig. 24. The two bolts detached.</p>
</div>

<p>There are a few details relating to this remarkable lock,
which may as well be introduced here in order to complete
the description. The principal bolt can be shot twice, or be
<i>double-locked</i>; hence it is furnished with three barbs for the
key to act against, and with three notches for the spring-stud.
The lower bolt <span class="smcapall">I K</span> can be shot by the horizontal pressure of
the button <span class="smcapall">P</span> (<a href="#Fig22">figs. 22</a>,
<a href="#Fig23">23</a>), which is situated on the inner side
of the door to which this lock is attached, so that a person inside
the room can secure the door against any one on the outside
who is not furnished with the proper key, for it must be
remarked that the small bolt as well as the large one is acted
on by the key. Now supposing the small bolt to be shot or
locked, it is kept so by the pressure of the coiled spring <span class="smcapall">Q</span>
(<a href="#Fig21">figs. 21</a>, <a href="#Fig22">22</a>). But this small bolt is connected with the large
one by means of the bent lever <span class="smcapall">O N M</span>
(<a href="#Fig21">figs. 21</a>, <a href="#Fig24">24</a>), which
turns on a pin <span class="smcapall">N</span> attached to the main bolt. Now, when both
bolts are either fully shot or unshot, the arm <span class="smcapall">O N</span> lies flat
against and parallel with the main bolt; but when the large
bolt is unshot and the small one not moved, the arms <span class="smcapall">O N</span>, <span class="smcapall">N M</span>,
fall into an inclined position, and the arm <span class="smcapall">O N</span> passing a little
below the main bolt comes within the range of the web of the
key, which in its revolution causes the bent lever to move upon
its centre <span class="smcapall">N</span>, thereby restoring <span class="smcapall">O N</span> to its horizontal position,
and at the same time causing the arm <span class="smcapall">N M</span> to move from right
to left, or in the direction for unshooting the small bolt; the
end of this arm thus catches into a mortise <span class="smcapall">V</span>
(<a href="#Fig21">figs. 21</a>, <a href="#Fig24">24</a>) in
the small bolt, and immediately unlocks it.</p>

<p>But to return to the subject of tumbler-locks. About the<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
year 1778, Mr. Barron introduced that species of double-action
(as it may perhaps be termed) which so greatly increases the
security of the simple tumbler, <a href="#Fig17">fig. 17</a>. In the tumbler-locks
previously made, if the tumbler were raised sufficiently high,
the lock could be opened: there was no such possibility as raising
it <i>too</i> high; but Mr. Barron, by his invention, patented 31st
October, 1778, rendered it absolutely necessary that a limit
should be put to the height to which the tumbler should be
raised, by rendering the bolt equally immovable whether the
tumbler were too much or too little raised. Another important
improvement was the introduction of two tumblers instead of
one. The bolt has in its middle a slot or gating notched on
both edges, the notches being fitted for the reception of studs
fixed to the tumblers. Supposing the studs or stumps of the
tumblers to be resting in the lower notches, they require to be
elevated to the general level of the gating before the bolt can
be moved; whereas, on the other hand, if the tumblers were
raised ever so little too high, the studs will enter the upper
notches, and prevent the shooting of the bolt. The lower
edge, or belly, of each tumbler is acted on by the steps of the
key during its circular movement; the leverage of the key
being so exactly adjusted as to raise the tumbler to the desired
height and no further. The tumblers are made unequally
wide, so that steps or inequalities in the bit of the key are
requisite to lift them both to the proper height. There are
thus two improvements introduced: there are two tumblers
instead of one, and each tumbler has a double instead of a
single action.</p>

<p>This ingenious and very useful lock is represented, so far
as regards its governing principle, in <a href="#Fig25">fig. 25</a>. The bolt is here
seen to have a peculiar slot or hole cut in it, consisting of a
narrow horizontal passage or gating, with three notches above
it and three below it. These double notches might be available
even for one tumbler only; but Barron used two or more
for the sake of additional security. In <a href="#Fig25">fig. 25</a> there are two
tumblers shewn, expressed by dotted lines; both are hinged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
one pivot, both are raised by the same action of the key, but
the stump on the one tumbler does not coincide in position
with that on the other. It will be seen that if the studs of the
tumblers rested in the lower notches, they would require to be
elevated to the level of the gating before the bolt could be
moved; while, on the other hand, if lifted too high, the
stumps would be caught in the upper notches, and would
equally prevent the passage of the bolt, The tumblers are
unequally wide; and the bitt of the key is stepped or notched
in a corresponding way, that there may be one step fitted to
act upon each tumbler. Mr. Barron also adopted the reverse
arrangement of having the stump on the bolt, and the openings
in the tumblers; so that the principle of his patent may be
concisely expressed as being “an arrangement to allow a
stump on the tumbler to pass through an opening in the bolt,
or a stump on the bolt to pass through an opening in the
tumbler.”</p>

<p>A very elaborate tumbler-lock, patented 23d February,
1790, by Mr. Rowntree, contrasts remarkably with the simplicity
of Barron’s lock. Mr. Rowntree’s lock consisted of
tumblers combined with revolving discs or wheels. Its mechanism
may be understood from the following description

<p class="blankbefore75"><span class="smcapall">A A</span> is the plate which encloses the whole mechanism of
the lock, and fastens it to the door; <span class="smcapall">B B</span> is the bolt, guided in
its motion by sliding under the bridges <span class="smcapall">C D</span>;
<span class="smcapall">E E</span> are pillars<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
which support a plate covering the works; <span class="smcapall">F</span> are the circular
wards surrounding the centre or key-pin; and <i>a</i> shews the
position of the key, which, in turning round, acts in a notch <i>r</i>
in the bolt, and propels it; <span class="smcapall">G</span>, the tumbler, is a plate situated
beneath the bolt, and moving on a centre-pin at <i>d</i>; it has a
catch or stump <i>e</i> projecting upwards, which enters the notches
<i>s</i> or <i>g</i> in the bolt, and thereby retains the latter for backward
or forward motion, as the case may be; <span class="smcapall">H</span> is a spring which
presses the tumbler forward. The key <i>a</i>, in turning round,
acts first against the part <i>c c</i> of the tumbler, and raises it so as
to remove the stump from the notches; it can then enter the
notch <i>r</i> in the bolt, and move it. So far there is no particular
security; but Mr. Rowntree sought to obtain it by the following
means. There is a piece of metal <i>h</i> fixed to the lower side
of the tumbler, called the <i>pin</i>; when the tumbler is caught in
either notch of the bolt, the pin applies itself to a cluster of<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
small wheels <span class="smcapall">I</span>, fitted on one centre-pin beneath the tumbler;
the edges of these wheels stop the pin, and prevent the tumbler
from being raised. But each wheel has a notch cut in its
circumference <span class="smcapall">I</span>; and it is only when the wheels are so placed
that all their notches lie in a right line, that the pin can enter
this compound notch and allow the tumbler to rise. The
wheels must therefore be all adjusted to position; and this is
effected by a number of levers <span class="smcapall">K</span> centred on one pin at <i>k</i>; at
the opposite end each lever has a tooth <i>m</i> entering a notch in
the wheel belonging to it; so that when any lever is pressed
outward, it turns its wheel round. Now this pressure of the
levers is brought about by a spring <i>n</i> applied to each; and when
so pressed, the levers rest against a pin <i>o</i> fixed in the plate.
The key is so cut as to determine the extent to which the
levers shall act upon the wheels. The key first operates from
the curved part <i>p p</i> of the levers <span class="smcapall">K</span>, and raising them, turns all
the wheels <span class="smcapall">I</span> at once into the proper positions; in turning
further round, it then operates on the part <i>c c</i> of the tumbler,
causing the latter to rise and to release the bolt; and in turning
still further round, it (the key) seizes the notch <i>r</i> of the
bolt, and shoots it. The key is cut into steps of different
lengths, as shewn at <span class="smcapall">V V</span>; each step operates on its respective
lever <span class="smcapall">K</span> in a different degree from the others; the notch at <i>s</i>
acts upon the tumbler, and the plain part <i>t</i> moves the bolt.</p>

<p>We now proceed to notice the modern tumbler-lock. This
was arranged by Bird, whose patent, bearing date 29th October,
1790, was for a series of four double-acting tumblers, differing
in no respect from those patented by Barron, and closely
resembling those in use at the present time in the best tumbler-locks.
We will describe the modern tumbler-lock more
particularly when we have gone through a few historical
details on the subject.</p>

<p>Messrs. Mitchell and Lawton obtained a patent bearing
date 7th March, 1815, for a lock in which were combined
with the bolt and double-acting tumblers, a series of movable
wards, and a revolving curtain for closing the key-hole. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
action of the wards was peculiar. On introducing any key
or instrument, and passing it round, a number of movable
wards or pieces were thrown out so as to prevent the key
from being turned back or withdrawn. It was necessary
therefore to pass round the key so as to unlock the lock, and
if that were not possible, as in the case of a false key being
used, it was held permanently, and could only be released by
destroying the lock, When the bolt was once shot, the wards
were carried up so as to leave a clear passage for the key.
This lock does not appear ever to have come into use, on
account of the violence required in case a wrong key should
be used either by accident or design.</p>

<p>The detention of a wrong key in this lock appears to have
suggested the contrivance of a <i>detector</i>. This was first made
by Ruxton, whose patent is dated 14th May, 1816. His detectors
were of various kinds, the object of each kind being to
give information to the owner in case any one of the tumblers
should be overlifted in an attempt to pick the lock, which fact
would be discovered on the next application of the true key.
This is precisely the object of the detector in tumbler-locks at
the present day, and Ruxton accomplished it by somewhat
similar means. He also had a contrivance for holding a false
key, as in Mitchell and Lawton’s lock; and he recommended
this form of detector in the following words: “It is true that in
this case the lock will have to be destroyed in order to open the
door: the result is frightful; but we think the more terrible
the result, the less likely would any one be to tamper with it.”</p>

<p>We now come to Chubb’s lock, patented 3d February, 1818,
which consisted of double-acting tumblers and a peculiar kind
of detector. This lock has been made the subject of various
patents obtained in the years 1824, 1833, 1846, and 1847.
This lock<a id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
consists of six separate and distinct double-acting<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
tumblers, all of which must be raised to a particular height,
neither more nor less, in order that the bolt may pass. It also
comprises a <i>detector</i>, by which, should any one of the tumblers
be lifted too high in an attempt to pick or open the lock by a
false key, it would be immediately detected on the next application
of the proper key. The tumblers are flat pieces of
iron or steel, with the plane of the surface vertical, and pivoted
at one end; and the following is the mode in which the key,
the tumblers, and the bolt, are brought into mutual action.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote4"></a><a href="#FNanchor4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
The lock about to be described is the latest and most complete form
of Chubb lock up to the date of the Great Exhibition. The various additions
and alterations which have been made in the lock since that date will
be noticed in a subsequent chapter.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The bolt shoots in and out of the lock in the usual way.
It has a square stud or stump riveted on one surface; and it
is to furnish obstructions to the passage of this stud that the
tumblers are provided. All the six tumblers are pivoted to
one pin at the end, giving to each of them a small leverage,
each independent of the others. There are six springs which
press these tumblers downwards, one to each tumbler. There
is a longitudinal slot or gating in each tumbler, large enough to
receive the stud of the bolt; and unless all the six slots (supposing
there to be six tumblers) coincide in height or position,
the stud will not have a clear passage for moving to and fro.
Now the slots are purposely made nearer the upper edge in
some of the tumblers than in others, all the six being different
in this respect; so that if they are all lifted <i>equally</i>, the slots
do not coincide, and the bolt and its stud will not pass. The
tumblers must then be raised <i>unequally</i>, those to be most raised
which have the slot nearest to the lower edge. To effect this,
the bit of the key is cut into six steps or inequalities, each to
act upon one particular tumbler, and each cut or stepped to the
exact depth which will suffice for the proper raising of the
tumbler. The key is inserted in the keyhole, and is turned;
the six steps raise the six tumblers all to the proper height, to
leave a clear passage along the slots; and the extreme end of
the key then acts upon the bolt itself, and shoots it. To unlock
it again, the same or a duplicate key must be used; for if another
key be employed, differing by ever so little from the proper
one, some one or more of the tumblers will be lifted either a<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
little too much or not quite enough; and in either case the stud
of the bolt will catch above or below the slot, instead of having
a clear line of movement along the slot itself. After both locking
and unlocking, the springs force the tumblers down as far
as they can go, burying the stud in the recesses above the slot;
so that the tumblers must be raised by the key both for locking
and unlocking.</p>

<p>The doctrine of chances has wide play in determining the
relative position of the six tumblers. In Mr. Chubb’s essay
this part of the subject is treated in the following way: “The
number of changes which may be effected on the keys of a
three-inch drawer-lock is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 = 720, the number
of different combinations which may be made on the six
steps of unequal lengths (on a six-tumbler lock), without altering
the length of either step. The height of the shortest step
is, however, capable of being reduced 20 times; and each time
of being reduced, the 720 combinations may be repeated;
therefore 720 × 20 = 14,400 changes. The same process, after
reducing the shortest step as much as possible, may be gone
through with each of the other five steps; therefore 14,400 × 6
= 86,400, which is the number of changes that can be produced
on the six steps. If, however, the seventh step, which throws
the bolt, be taken into account, the reduction of it only ten
times would give 86,400 × 10 = 864,000, as the number of
changes on locks with the keys all of one size (that is, with
one key of definite size in all save the lengths of the steps).
Moreover, the drill pins of the locks and the pipes of the keys
may be easily made of three different sizes; and the number
of changes will then be 864,000 × 3 = 2,592,000, as the whole
series of changes which may be gone through with this key.
In smaller keys, the steps of which are capable of being reduced
only ten times, and the bolt-step only five times, the number of
combinations will be 720 × 10 × 6 × 5 × 3 = 648,000. On the
other hand, in larger keys, the steps of which can be reduced
thirty times, and the bolt-step twenty times, the total number of
combinations will be 720 × 30 × 6 × 20 × 3 = 7,776,000.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span></p>

<p>These enormous numbers have been the cause of much
of the wonderment which the six-tumbler locks have excited;
and, as we shall see further on, the Bramah lock presents still
more of the marvellous in respect to this ringing of the
changes.</p>

<p class="caption">fig. 31. Chubb lock, with detector and six tumblers.</p>
</div>

<p>The construction and action of the Chubb lock may be
further illustrated by means of an engraving, <a href="#Fig31">fig. 31</a>, in
which <i>b</i> is the bolt of the lock, with a stump riveted to it
marked <i>s</i>. The six tumblers are shewn perspectively, the
front or anterior one being marked <i>t</i>; they all move on the
centre-pin <i>a</i>, but are nevertheless perfectly distinct and separate,
to allow of being elevated to different heights. At <i>d</i> is
shewn one end of a divided spring, the divisions being equal
to the number of tumblers, one to each, and so bent that each
spring may press upon its particular tumbler. At <i>e</i> is the detector-spring,
so placed that a projecting piece in the hindmost
tumbler shall be near it; this tumbler having also fixed into
it a stud or pin <i>p</i>. This being the arrangement, especially in
relation to the stump <i>s</i> and the tumblers, it follows that all
the tumblers must be lifted to exact and regulated heights in
order that the stump may pass through the longitudinal slits
of the tumblers; unless it can do so, the bolt cannot be withdrawn.
As there are gaps or notches in each tumbler both<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
above and below the proper line of passage, and as there are
no ordinary means of ascertaining when any one tumbler is
lifted too high or not high enough, the safety of the lock is
greatly increased by this uncertainty; especially when it is
considered that this uncertainty is multiplied sixfold by the
different modes in which the six tumblers are slotted. If,
through the insertion of a false key, or by any other cause,
any one of the tumblers be raised above its proper position,
the detector spring <i>e</i> will catch the hindmost tumbler, and retain
it so as to prevent the bolt from passing; and thus, upon
the next application of the true key, it will be instantly felt
that some one of the tumblers has been overlifted, because the
true key will not unlock it. To relieve the bolt from this
temporary imprisonment, the key must be turned the reverse
way, as for locking; all the tumblers will thus be brought to
their proper position, and allow the stump to enter the notches
<i>n n´</i>; the bevelled part of the bolt will then lift up the detector-spring,
and allow the hindmost tumbler to fall down into its
proper place; and all this being effected, the lock may be
opened and shut in the ordinary way. The pin <i>p</i> is so adjusted
that if any one of the tumblers&mdash;front, back, or intermediate&mdash;be
lifted too high, the pin will be lifted with it, and
will catch into the detector-spring, thus producing the result
just described.</p>

Key to Chubb’s lock.</p>
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The key is represented in <a href="#Fig32">fig. 32</a>. It has six steps, besides
a terminal step to act upon the bolt.
The height of each step, or the distance to
which it extends from the pipe of the key,
depends of course on the height to which
its corresponding tumbler is to be lifted;
and it matters not whether the steps of the
key are adjusted to the slots of the tumblers,
or the slots to the steps, provided the agreement
be brought about. It is simply a matter
of manufacturing convenience that the key-steps
are cut first and the tumbler-slots afterwards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
We may here remark that <i>bit</i>, or <i>bitt</i>, is the name
given, somewhat indefinitely, either to the whole flat part
of a key, or to the small stepped portions of it. The
flat part was formerly termed the <i>web</i> of the key, probably
from the <i>webbed</i> appearance of the keys to complex warded
locks.</p>

<p>After the reading of Mr. Chubb’s paper before the Institution
of Civil Engineers, Mr. Owen narrated one or two circumstances
connected with the early history of Chubb’s lock. A
convict on board one of the prison-ships at Portsmouth dockyard,
who was by profession a lock-maker, and who had been
employed in London in making and repairing locks for several
years, and subsequently had been notorious for picking locks,
asserted that he had picked with ease one of the best of Bramah’s
locks, and that he could pick Chubb’s locks with equal
facility. One of the latter was secured by the seals of the
late Sir George Grey, the Commissioner, and some of the
principal officers of the dockyard, and given to the convict,
together with files and all the tools which he stated were
necessary for preparing false instruments for the purpose, as
also blank keys to fit the pin of the lock. A lock exactly the
same in principle was placed in his hands, that he might examine
it and make himself master of its construction. If he
succeeded in opening the lock, he was to receive a free pardon
from the Government, and a reward of 100<i>l.</i> from Messrs.
Chubb. After trying for two or three months to pick the
sealed lock&mdash;during which time, by his repeated efforts, he
frequently over-lifted the detector, which was as often re-adjusted
for his subsequent trials&mdash;he gave up the attempt.
He stated that Chubb’s were the most secure locks he had
ever met with, and that it was impossible for any man to pick
or to open them with false instruments.</p>

<p>Mr. Owen further stated, that in order to compare the
merits of Bramah’s and Chubb’s locks, he had suggested a mechanical
contrivance, which was applied to one of Bramah’s
six-spring padlocks belonging to the Excise. It was hung<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
upon a nail, in a vertical position, secure from lateral oscillation.
A self-acting apparatus was then applied, consisting of
a pipe with hexagonal grooves, and a stud or bit corresponding
with the division of the lock, and secured to it by a spring.
In the grooves of this pipe small slides were inserted, which
pressed against the spring keys of the lock; to these slides were
attached levers, acted upon by eccentrics, moved by a combination
of wheels, whose teeth differed in number so as to perform
the permutation required for the different depths of the spring
keys, corresponding with those of the proper key to the lock.
The automaton machine was set in motion by a line working
over a barrel, and acted upon by a weight; and was thus left
acting upon the mechanism for a considerable time. At right
angles to the pipe or false key was attached a rod and weight;
and when the notches in the spring keys were brought in a
line with the plane of the plate or diaphragm of the lock, the
rod and weight turned the false key, opened the lock, and
stopped the further motion of the automaton. In that state
the slides indicated the exact depth of the grooves in the proper
key, and gave the form of a matrix by which to make a key
similar to the original one. The automaton worked during a
period varying from half an hour to three hours, according to
the state of permutation of the apparatus at the moment of
being applied, compared with that of the slides in the lock.
We confess that it is difficult to understand the action of this
automaton from Mr. Owen’s description. We imagine that
the false notches would effectually prevent the operation of
the instrument, and openings would be required on each slide
to bring it back, so as to meet the motions of the machine.</p>

<p>Mr. Owen did not state whether his apparatus had been
successful with one only of Bramah’s locks or with several;
nor did he describe any apparatus invented with the view to
the picking of Chubb’s locks. He stated, however, that in
order to ascertain the effect of friction on one of these last-named
locks, it was subjected to the alternate rectilinear motion
of a steam-engine in Portsmouth dockyard, and was locked<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
and unlocked upwards of 460,000 times consecutively, without
any appreciable wear being indicated by a gauge applied to
the levers and the key, both before and after this alternate
action. Mr. Owen concluded by expressing his individual
opinion that Chubb’s lock had never been picked. “The detector
was the main feature of its excellence; and additional
precaution, therefore, was only departing from its simplicity,
and adding to the expense, without any commensurate advantage.”</p>

<p>In a subsequent chapter the degree of security afforded by
various descriptions of locks, and the obstacles which they
present of being picked, will come under notice; we therefore
now proceed to describe briefly a few other tumbler-locks, or
application of the tumbler-principle.</p>

<p>In Mr. Somerford’s lock, for which the Society of Arts gave
a premium in 1818, an attempt was made to improve upon
the ordinary action of tumblers. In most such locks, all the
tumblers must ascend, although to different heights, before
the stud of the bolt can pass through the slots; “which arrangement,”
says Mr. Somerford, “gives an opportunity of introducing
a nail, or a piece of stout wire, into the lock, and thus
raising the tumblers without the necessity of using the key.”
In his new lock, however, he made one lever to ascend while
the other descended, by a somewhat complicated arrangement
of slotted plates above and below the bolt. The key was so
perforated as to be much endangered in respect to strength.</p>

<p>In Davis’s lock there is a double chamber with wards on
the side of the key-hole. The key is inserted into the first
chamber and turned a quarter round; it is then pushed forward
into the inner chamber, where there is a rotating plate containing
a series of small pins or studs, which are laid hold
of by the key. By turning the key, the plate is moved round,
the tumbler is raised, and the bolt is shot backwards and
forwards. This lock, which is somewhat expensive, is used
to some extent on Cabinet despatch-boxes.</p>

<p>The lock invented by Mr. Nettlefold is so constructed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
that when the bolt is shot out by the key, two teeth or
quadrants are projected from the sides of the bolt, which take
a firm hold of the plate fixed on the door-post or edge. This
construction is said to answer well for sliding-doors.</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Ainger, in 1820, received a silver medal from
the Society of Arts for a draw-back spring latch, in which the
objects proposed were the two following&mdash;to render the lock
more difficult of violation by a pick than those ordinarily in
use; and to apply to it a key of which no ordinary person
could take an impress, and which would be difficult of access
even in a workman’s hand. The key is very peculiar; its
pipe consists of three divisions, the section of the upper and
lower divisions being circular, and that of the middle division
triangular; the triangular portion is intended to give motion to
some part of the interior of the lock during the rotation of the
key. There are collars fixed on the extremity of the key,
to act each on one tumbler; and there are modes, by varying
the arrangement of these collars on an octagonal stem,
to give something like a permutation to the number of variations
to which the action of the key may be subject. The
notches or slots are rather in the bolt than in the tumblers;
and there are many peculiarities in the general arrangement.</p>

<p>In a lock invented and patented by Mr. Parsons, the tumblers
are of a particular form, being hinged on a pivot at their
centres, and working into and out of two notches cut in the
under side of the bolt. It must be obvious that many variations
in the adjustment of the tumblers of locks might be made,
without vitiating the principle on which the action depends.</p>

<p>Many inventors have tried the use of an expanding web
to the key, so planned that if the step of the web be long
enough to reach the tumbler, it would be too long to pass
through the key-hole; and therefore a principle of safety would
operate by enabling the key to adjust itself at one moment to
the size of the key-hole, and at another to the height of the
tumbler. Mr. Machin of Wolverhampton invented such a key
in 1827. The web of the key is movable on a countersunk<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
pin, on which it can so far slide as to be drawn one-eighth of
an inch from the barrel. The key-hole is of such a size as to
admit the key only when the web is pressed close up to the
barrel. When the key in this state is introduced, and is begun
to be turned round, one of the notches in the web works into a
raised circular edge of steel, placed eccentrically with regard
to the lock-pin; so that as the key is turned, the web becomes
drawn out, and is at its greatest elongation when it arrives at
the tumblers: in the second half of its circular movement, the
key becomes contracted to its original dimensions, and can then
be removed from the lock.</p>

<p>Another mode of modifying the key has been introduced
by Mr. Mackinnon, the object being to enable any person to
change at will the pattern or arrangement of the movable
parts of a lock and key; or to keep the key, when not actually
in use, in such a state as to render it unavailing to any one but
himself. It was a complex arrangement, which does not seem
to have come much into use.</p>

<p>The lock invented by Mr. Williams, in 1839, may be designated
a pin-lock, involving a principle analogous in many
points to that of the Egyptian lock. This lock has a series
of pins which reach through the cap, and are pressed to their
places with a key like a comb or a rake-head. On the inner
end of each pin is a flat piece of steel, in which is cut a notch
for the passage of the bolt; but this passage is not clear until
the notches in all the pieces of steel are in a right line.
The pins are movable, and can be pushed either too far or
not far enough to bring about the coincidence of position in
the notches; and on this ground they are “double-acting.”
Now the teeth of the key are of irregular lengths, each having
a length just suited for pushing the pin to the proper depth:
any other lengths of teeth would fail to open the lock. There
is a mechanism of springs and levers to shoot the bolt when
the pins in the plate are rightly adjusted. The arrangements
in respect to the key are singular and somewhat awkward.
The teeth which lock the bolt are not the same as those<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
which unlock it, the user having to change ends and adjust
the bit to a socket-handle. This is one among many
examples in which a lock embodies several principles, the inventor
having set himself the task of combining the excellences
of many diverse locks.</p>

<p>In respect to the tumbler-locks generally, the simplicity
of action, the strength of construction, and the non-liability
of disarrangement, have given them a high place among
safety-locks. The only danger seemed to be, that any person
once obtaining possession of the key could take an impression
from it, and thence form a key which would command the
lock. Attempts have been occasionally made to obviate this
danger, by supplying the key with movable bits which could
be changed at pleasure, so as to constitute any number of
effectively different bits in succession. But the locks being
so constructed that the bolt could only be moved when the
tumblers were in a certain position, the owner was placed in
this predicament: that it was useless to alter the arrangement
of the bits in the key, unless the tumblers were altered in a
corresponding manner; and this would entail the removal of
the lock from the door, and the re-arrangement of the interior
mechanism.</p>

<p>One of the great defects of tumbler-locks made previously
to the last ten years was, that the tumblers, when lying at
rest in the lock, presented at their <i>bellies</i> or lower edges precisely
the same arrangement as the steps of the key. Indeed,
in many locks of the present day, a good idea of the form of
the key may be gained by feeling the bellies of the tumblers.
The bellies are in fact cut out so as to compensate for the
circular motion of the key, to allow them to remain at rest
while the stump is passing through the gating. Even in
tumbler-locks of the best construction the tumblers will vibrate
more or less during the motion of the key; a defect which
must be provided against in adjusting the lock, or the stump
will be caught in its passage through the gating. Mr. Hobbs
provides a simple remedy by enlarging the back part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
gating, the effect of which is as follows: when, in shooting
back the bolt, as in unlocking, the key has got to its
highest point, the stump enters the narrow end of the gating;
but in shooting the bolt forward, as in locking, the stump
enters the gating before the key has got to its highest point,
and to allow for the slight vibratory motion of the tumblers
during the passage of the stump, the gating is widened. The
usual method of adjustment is to alter the forms of the bellies
of the tumblers, thus greatly risking the security of the lock,
a defect which was clearly perceived by Bramah [see <a href="#Page67">pp.
67</a>-<a href="#Page70">70</a>], and was one of the reasons which induced him to
construct locks with slides instead of tumblers.</p>

<p>American locks on the tumbler-principle, and the relation
which all such locks bear to the Bramah lock, will be better
understood after the details of the following chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER VI.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE BRAMAH LOCK.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The lock which was invented by the late Mr. Bramah deservedly
occupies a high place among this class of contrivances.
It differs very materially from all which has gone before it;
its mechanical construction is accurate and beautiful; its key
is remarkable for smallness of size; and the invention was
introduced by the publication of an essay containing much
sensible observation on locks generally. The full title of this
essay runs thus: “A dissertation on the Construction of Locks.
Containing, first, reasons and observations, demonstrating all
locks which depend upon fixed wards to be erroneous in principle,
and defective in point of security. Secondly, a specification
of a lock, constructed on a new and infallible principle,
which, possessing all the properties essential to security, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
prevent the most ruinous consequences of house-robberies,
and be a certain protection against thieves of all descriptions.”
A second edition of this <i>Dissertation</i> was published in 1815;
but the work is now extremely scarce, and hardly attainable.</p>

<p>It is remarkable to observe the boldness and self-relying
confidence with which Mr. Bramah, some sixty years ago, declared
that <i>all</i> locks were, up to that time, violable; he felt
that this was strictly true, and he hesitated not to give
expression to his conviction. The following is from his
<i>Dissertation</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is observable that those who are taken in the desperate
occupation of house-breaking are always furnished with a
number and variety of keys or other instruments adapted to
the purpose of picking or opening locks; and it needs no
argument to prove that these implements must be essential
to the execution of their intentions. For unless they can
secure access to the portable and most valuable part of the
effects, which in most families are deposited under the imaginary
security of locks, the plunder would seldom recompense
the difficulty and hazard of the enterprise; and till some
method of security be adopted by which such keys and instruments
may be rendered useless, no effectual check or opposition
can be given to the excessive and alarming practice of
house-breaking.</p>

<p>“Being confident that I have contrived a security which
no instrument but its proper key can reach; and which
may be so applied as not only to defy the art and ingenuity
of the most skilful workman, but to render the utmost force
ineffectual, and thereby to secure what is most valued as
well from dishonest servants as from the midnight ruffian,
I think myself at liberty to declare (what nothing but the
discovery of an infallible remedy would justify my disclosing),
that all dependence on the inviolable security of locks, even
of those which are constructed on the best principle of any
in general use, is fallacious. To demonstrate this bold and
alarming proposition, I shall first state the common principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
which are applied in the art of lock-making; and by describing
their operation in instruments differently constructed,
prove to my intelligent readers that the best-constructed locks
are liable to be secretly opened with great facility; and that
the locks in common use are calculated only to induce a false
confidence in their effect, and to throw temptation to dishonesty
in the way of those who are acquainted with their
imperfections, and know their inefficacy to the purpose of
security” (p. 5).</p>

<p>Tumblers had been so little thought of and used at the
time Bramah wrote, that his attention was almost exclusively
directed to <i>warded</i> locks. The mysterious clefts in a key,
connected with some kind of secret mechanism in the lock,
had given the warded locks a great hold on the public
mind, as models of puzzlement and security; and it was to
shew that this confidence rested on a false basis, that he to
a great extent laboured. The following is his exposition of
the principle and the defects of the warded lock.</p>

<p>“Locks have been constructed, and are at present much
used and held in great esteem, from which the picklock is
effectually excluded; but the admission of false keys is an
imperfection for which no locksmith has ever found a corrective;
nor can this imperfection be remedied whilst the protection
of the bolt is wholly confided to fixed wards. For if a
lock of any given size be furnished with wards in as curious
and complete a manner as it can be, those wards being necessarily
expressed on what is termed by locksmiths the bit or
web of the key, do not admit of a greater number of variations
than can be expressed on that bit or web; when, therefore,
as many locks have been completed of the given size as will
include all the variations which the surface of the bit will
contain, every future lock must be the counterpart of some
former one, and the same key which opens the one will of
course unlock the other. It hence follows that every lock which
shall be fabricated on this given scale, beyond the number at
which the capability of variation ends, must be as subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
the key of some other lock as to its own; and both become
less secure as their counterparts become more numerous.
This objection is confirmed by a reference to the locks commonly
fixed on drawers and bureaus, in which the variations
are few, and these so frequently repeated, from the infinite
demand for such locks, that, even if it were formed to resist
the picklock, they would be liable to be opened by ten thousand
correspondent keys. And the same observation applies
in a greater or less degree to every lock in which the variations
are not endless.</p>

<p>“But if the variation of locks in which the bolt is guarded
only by fixed wards could be multiplied to infinity, they would
afford no security against the efforts of an ingenious locksmith;
for though an artful and judicious arrangement of the wards,
or other impediments, may render the passage to the bolt so
intricate and perplexed as to exclude every instrument but its
proper key, a skilful workman having access to the entrance
will be at no loss to fabricate a key which shall tally as perfectly
with the wards as if the lock had been open to his inspection.
And this operation may not only be performed to
the highest degree of certainty and exactness, but is conducted
likewise with the utmost ease. For the block or bit, which is
intended to receive the impression of the wards, being fitted to
the keyhole, and the shank of the key bored to a sufficient
depth to receive the pipe, nothing remains but to cover the
bit with a preparation which, by a gentle pressure against the
introductory ward, may receive its impression, and thus furnish
a certain direction for the application of the file. The
block or bit being thus prepared with a tally to the first ward,
gains admission to the second; and a repetition of the means
by which the first impression was obtained, enables the workman
to proceed, till by the dexterous use of his file he has
effected a free passage to the bolt. And in this operation he
is directed by an infallible guide; for, the pipe being a fixed
centre on which the key revolves without any variation, and
the wards being fixed likewise, their position must be accurately<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
described on the surface of the bit which is prepared to
receive their impression. The key therefore may be formed
and perfectly fitted to the lock without any extraordinary degree
of genius or mechanical skill. It is from hence evident
that endless variations in the disposition of fixed wards are not
alone sufficient to the purpose of perfect security. I do not
mean to subtract from the merit of such inventions, nor to
dispute their utility or importance. Every approach towards
perfection in the art of lock-making may be productive of
much good, and is at least deserving of commendation; for if
no higher benefit were to result from it, than the rendering
difficult or impossible to many that which is still practicable
and easy to a few, it furnishes a material security against
those from whom the greatest mischiefs and dangers are to be
apprehended.”</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, in the present day, that Bramah
did not over-rate the fallacies embodied in the system of wards
for locks. He was sufficiently a machinist to detect the weak
points in the ordinary locks; and, whatever may have been
his over-estimate of his own lock (presently to be described),
he was certainly guilty of no injustice to those who had preceded
him; for their locks were substantially as he has described
them. To understand the true bearings of his Dissertation
too, we must remember that housebreaking had risen
to a most daring height in London at the time he wrote (about
the middle of the reign of George III.); and men’s minds were
more than usually absorbed by considerations relating to their
doors and locks.</p>

<p>Mr. Bramah, after doing due justice to the ingenuity of
Barron’s lock, in which, if the tumbler be either <i>over</i> lifted or
<i>under</i> lifted the lock cannot be opened, pointed out very clearly
the defective principle which still governed the lock. “Greatly
as the art is indebted to the ingenuity of Mr. Barron, he has
not yet attained that point of excellence in the construction of
his lock which is essential to perfect security. His improvement
has greatly increased the difficulty but not precluded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
possibility of opening his lock by a key made and obtained as
above described (by a wax impression on a blank key); for an
impression of the tumblers may be taken by the same method,
and the key be made to act upon them as accurately as it may
be made to tally with the wards. Nor will the practicability
of obtaining such a key be prevented, however complicated
the principle or construction of the lock may be, whilst the
disposition of its parts may be ascertained and their impression
correctly taken from without. I apprehend the use of
additional tumblers to have been applied by Mr. Barron as
a remedy for this imperfection.” Mr. Bramah thought that
Barron had a perception of a higher degree of security, but
had failed to realise it; because, by giving a uniform motion
to the tumblers, and presenting them with a face which tallies
exactly with the key, they still partake in a very great degree
of the nature of fixed wards, and the security of the lock is
thereby rendered in a proportionate degree defective and liable
to doubt.</p>

<p>To shew how this insecurity arises, Mr. Bramah illustrates
the matter in the following way: “Suppose the key with
which the workman is making his way to the bolt to have
passed the wards, and to be in contact with the most prominent
of the tumblers. The impression, which the slightest
touch will leave on the key, will direct the application of the
file till sufficient space is prepared to give it a free passage.
This being accomplished, the key will of course bear upon the
tumbler which is most remote; and being formed by this process
to tally with the face which the tumblers present, will
acquire as perfect a command of the lock as if it had been
originally made for the purpose. And the key, being thus
brought to a bearing on all the tumblers at once, the benefit
arising from the increase of their number, if multiplied by
fifty, must inevitably be lost; for, having but one motion, they
act only with the effect of one instrument.”</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice, that even while thus shewing the
weak points of the Barron lock, Mr. Bramah seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
had in his mind some conception of infallibility or inviolability
attainable by the lock in question. After speaking of the defect
arising from the bad arrangement of the tumblers, he
says: “But nothing is more easy than to remove this objection,
and to obtain perfect security from the application of
Mr. Barron’s principle. If the tumblers, which project unequally
and form a fixed tally to the key, were made to present
a plane surface, it would require a separate and unequal
motion to disengage them from the bolt; and consequently
no impression could be obtained from without that would give
any idea of their positions with respect to each other, or be of
any use even to the most skilful and experienced workman in
the formation of a false key. The correction of this defect
would rescue the principle of Mr. Barron’s lock, as far as I
am capable of judging, from every imputation of error or imperfection;
and, as long as it could be kept unimpaired, would
be a perfect security. But the tumblers, on which its security
depends, being of slight substance, exposed to perpetual friction&mdash;as
well from the application of the key as from their
own proper motion&mdash;and their office being such as to render
the most trifling loss of metal fatal to their operation, they
would need a further exertion of Mr. Barron’s ingenuity to
make them durable.”</p>

<p>It may perhaps be doubted whether the principle of
Bramah’s lock is not more clearly shewn in the original constructed
by him than in that of later date. In appearance it is
totally different, but the same pervading principle is observable
in both; and the cylinder lock can certainly be better understood
when this original flat lock has been studied. The
annexed <a href="#Fig33">woodcut</a> is taken from the first and very scarce
edition of Mr. Bramah’s <i>Dissertation</i>; the description is somewhat
more condensed, but perhaps sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig33">
<img src="images/illo071.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 33. Bramah’s first model.</p>
</div>

<p>The lock is supposed to be lying flat, with the bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span> half-shot.
Ranged somewhat diagonally are six levers, turning on
a horizontal joint or pivot at <span class="smcapall">A</span>, each lever having a slight
extent of vertical motion independent of the others. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
lever rests on a separate spring of sufficient strength to sustain
its weight, or, if depressed by a superior force, to restore
it to its proper position when the force is withdrawn. <span class="smcapall">F</span> is a
curved piece of metal, pierced with six grooves or passages;
these grooves are exactly equal in width to the thickness of the
levers, but are of sufficient depth to allow the levers a free
motion in a perpendicular direction. The ends of the levers
are inserted in these grooves, and have this freedom of motion,
whether lifted by the elastic power of the springs or depressed
by a weight from above. In the bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span> is a notch to receive
a peculiarly-shaped lever, which shoots or withdraws the bolt
according as it traverses to the right or the left. This lever, the
six long levers, the springs beneath them, the bent piece <span class="smcapall">F</span>,
and the pivot, all alike are fixed to a circular platform <span class="smcapall">P</span>,
which turns on a centre; so that if any force can make this
platform turn partially round, the bolt must be shot or unshot
by the lever which works in the notch. The six long levers<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
are the contrivances whereby the platform shall <i>not</i> be allowed
to turn until the proper moving agent (the key) shall have
been applied, the plate <i>p</i> being one of the assistants in this
obstruction. This plate, which is hollow underneath, has six
notches in one of its edges; the points of the levers catch into
these notches; and while so caught, the levers cannot move horizontally,
and all the machinery is at a stand-still. To enable
the key to set the mechanism in action, other contrivances
are necessary. Each lever has a notch at its extreme end,
and the six are notched very irregularly in respect one to
another. These notches must be brought all into one plane,
to enable the levers to pass horizontally out of the notches
in the plate, in the same way as the two prongs of a fork
might traverse one above and the other below the blade of a
knife; and when the lever-notches are in this position, all in
one plane and in the plane of the plate, the levers can be
moved, and with it the stump which shoots the bolt. To ensure
this due pressing down of the levers, a key is used such
as is shewn in the <a href="#Fig33">cut</a>, having six steps or bits to correspond
with the six levers; this key, put upon the pin <span class="smcapall">K</span>, presses
down all the levers to the exact distance necessary for bringing
their notches into one plane, viz. the plane of the plate;
the key then being turned round turns the movable platform
<span class="smcapall">P</span>, and shoots the bolt. It is evident at a glance, that
unless the various steps of the key are so cut, that each shall
press down its own lever to the proper extent, the ends of the
levers cannot pass the notches in the plate, and the bolt can
neither be locked nor unlocked.</p>

<p>It may be well to give Bramah’s own words in relation to
this lock: “I may safely assert that it is not in art to produce
a key or other instrument by which a lock constructed on
this principle can be opened. It will be a task, indeed, of
great difficulty, even to a skilful workman, to fit a key to this
species of lock, though its interior face were open to his inspection;
for the levers being raised by the subjacent springs
to an equal height present a <i>plane</i> surface, and consequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
convey no direction that can be of any use in forming a tally
to the <i>irregular</i> surface which they present when acting in
subjection to the proper key. Unless, therefore, a method be
contrived to bring the notches on the ends of the levers in
a direct line with each other, and <i>to retain them in that position
till an exact impression of the irregular surface which the levers
will then exhibit can be taken</i>, the workman will in vain
attempt to fit a key to the lock, or by any effort of art to
move the bolt. And when it is considered that this process
will be greatly impeded, and may perhaps be entirely frustrated,
by the action of the springs, it must appear that great
patience and perseverance, as well as great ingenuity, will be
required to give any chance of succeeding in the attempt.
I do not state this circumstance as a point essential or of any
importance to the purpose of the lock, but to prove more
clearly what I have before observed upon its principle and
properties; for if such difficulties occur to a skilled workman,
as to render it almost, if not altogether impracticable to form
a key when the lock is open to his inspection and its parts
accessible to his hand, it pretty clearly demonstrates the impossibility
of accomplishing it when no part of the movement
can be touched or seen.”</p>

<p>It is evident that Mr. Bramah had his thoughts directed
to that mode of picking locks which depends on taking impressions
of the moving parts, rather than to the <i>mechanical</i> or
<i>pressure</i> method which has been developed in later times.
There can be little doubt that a lock was, to his mind, a
beautiful and admirable machine, far elevated above the level
of mere blacksmith’s work; and his name will ever be associated
with what may be termed the philosophy of lock-making.</p>

<p>After the model-lock, which has just been described, was
constructed, and found to corroborate the idea which was
working in Mr. Bramah’s mind, he proceeded to the construction
of his barrel or cylinder-lock, embracing similar elements
placed in more convenient juxta-position. In his Essay he
gives an engraving to illustrate the principle on which his lock<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
acts, rather in the manner of a diagram than as depicting any
lock actually made; his main object being to impart a clear
notion of the action of the slides which form such a distinguishing
feature in his lock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig34">
<img src="images/illo074.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 34. Diagram to illustrate the Bramah lock.</p>
</div>

<p>Viewed in this sense, therefore, simply as an illustrative
diagram, the annexed <a href="#Fig34">cut</a> may represent the action of the
safety slides. <span class="smcapall">B</span> is a sliding bar or bolt, having a power of
longitudinal motion in the frame <span class="smcapall">F</span>. This frame has six
notches cut on each of its long sides, the two series being
exactly opposite each other; and there are six similar notches
cut in the bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span>. The concurrent effect of all these eighteen
notches is, that the six slides <i>a b c d e f</i> can move freely up and
down across the bolt. When the slides are thus placed, the bolt
cannot move, and may in this case be considered to be locked.
There are six clefts or notches in the six slides, one to each
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6); and until all these are brought in a right
line, the bolt cannot move through them. If a tally or key
be prepared, as shewn at <span class="smcapall">T</span> in the lower part of the cut, with
six projections, and if these projections thrust up the six
slides till their clefts rise to the plane of the bolt, then can
the bolt be withdrawn or the lock opened. This serves to
illustrate the relation between the slides and the key, as
carried out in the way now to be described.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of the Bramah lock is, that from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
essential part of the apparatus being a barrel or cylinder, much
of the working can be conducted in the lathe; and this has
given a beauty to the details generally and deservedly admired.
Mr. Bramah, when he worked out the theory of his lock,
resolved to discard altogether the use of fixed wards, and also
the use of tumblers working on a pivot at one end; substituting
in their stead a system of slides, working in a very novel
way. The body of a Bramah lock may be considered as
formed of two concentric brass barrels, the outer one fixed,
and the inner rotating within it. The inner barrel has a projecting
stud, which, while the barrel is rotating, comes in
contact with the bolt in such a way as to shoot or lock it;
and thus the stud serves the same purpose as the bit of an
ordinary key, rendering the construction of a bit to the
Bramah key unnecessary. If the barrel can be made to rotate
to the right or left, the bolt can be locked or unlocked; and
the problem is, therefore, how to ensure the rotation of the
barrel. The key, which has a pipe or hollow shaft, is inserted
in the keyhole upon the pin, and is then turned round; but
there must be a very nice adjustment of the mechanism of the
barrel before this turning round of the key and the barrel can
be ensured. The barrel has an external circular groove at
right angles to the axis, penetrating to a certain depth; and
it has also several <i>internal</i> longitudinal grooves, from end to
end. In these internal grooves thin pieces of steel are able
to slide, in a direction parallel with the axis of the barrel.
A thin plate of steel, called the locking-plate, is screwed in two
portions to the outer barrel, concentric with the inner barrel;
and at the same time occupying the external circular groove
of the inner barrel; this plate has notches, fitted in number
and size to receive the edges of the slides which work in the
internal longitudinal grooves of the barrel. If this were all, the
barrel could not revolve, because the slides are catching in the
grooves of the locking-plate; but each slide has also a groove,
corresponding in depth to the extent of this entanglement;
and if this groove be brought to the plane of the locking-plate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
the barrel can be turned, so far as respects that individual
slide. All the slides must, however, be so adjusted that their
grooves shall come to the same plane; but as the notch is cut
at different points in the lengths of the several slides, the slides
have to be pushed in to different distances in the barrel, in
order that this juxta-position of notches may be ensured.
This is effected by the key, which has notches or clefts at the
end of the pipe equal in number to the slides, and made to
fit the ends of the slides when the key is inserted; the key
presses each slide, and pushes it so far as the depth of its cleft
will permit; and all these depths are such that all the slides
are pushed to the exact position where their notches all lie in
the same plane; this is the plane of the locking-plate, and the
barrel can be then turned.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This is the principle which Mr. Bramah adopted; and we
have now to trace it, step by step, by means of illustrative
details. <a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a> represents the exterior of a box or desk lock,
one among many varieties which the Bramah lock presents.
<span class="smcapall">A A</span> shews the bolt, formed something like two hooks rising
out of a bar of metal, which bar has a backward and forward
motion upon the plate <span class="smcapall">B B</span>. The upper edge of this plate is
turned over at right angles, forming a small horizontal surface
through which two openings are cut to receive the two hooked
portions of the bolt. The movements of the bolt are otherwise
guided by the edges of square holes through which it works;<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
the holes being made in the edge-pieces of the lock, riveted to
the main plate. The bolt is further prevented from rising out
of its place by means of a plate of
metal <span class="smcapall">C</span>, which is secured to the edge-pieces
by two screws 1, 1, and by two
steadying pieces. This plate has on
its surface a cylindrical projection <span class="smcapall">D</span>,
which contains in effect all the working
mechanism of the lock. The pins
4 4 are employed for securing a plate,
which we shall have to describe presently.
When such a lock is fixed
upon a desk or box, the portion <i>D</i>
projects to a small distance through
a hole in the wood-work, forming in
itself a very neat escutcheon, with a
key-hole in the centre.</p>

<p class="caption">fig. 37.
The slides.</p>
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>So much for the exterior. We
must now proceed to examine the interior
of the lock, especially the part
contained within the cylinder. In <a href="#Fig36">fig.
36</a>, for convenience of arrangement,
the several parts are exhibited separately,
and as if the plane of the lock
were horizontal, with the key acting
vertically. The essential part of the
mechanism is a barrel or cylinder <i>E</i>,
pierced or bored with a cylindrical
hole down its centre. The inside of the bore has six narrow
grooves, cut parallel with the axis, and in the direction of
radii; the grooves are not cut through the thickness
of the cylinder, but leave sufficient substance
of metal for strength. In every groove is fitted a
steel slide of peculiar form, such as is shewn at <i>a´ a´</i>
in <a href="#Fig37">fig. 37</a>. Each slide is split in its thickness
(seen in section), so that it may move up and
down in its groove with a slight friction, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
thereby not fall simply by its own weight. Each slide has
three small notches (3, 2, 3´), the use of which will presently
appear. Reverting to <a href="#Fig36">fig. 36</a>, the lower part of the opening
through the cylinder <i>E</i> is closed by a circular plate of metal,
fixed to it by two screws; this plate is represented at <i>F</i>, in the
lower part of the figure. This plate has a vertical pin rising
from its centre (also seen at <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig39">fig. 39</a>), and serving as a key-pin
on which the pipe of the key may work or slide; and it
has also a short circular stud <i>c</i> projecting from its under side,
and fitted to enter into a curved opening in the bolt presently
to be described.</p>

<p>The point to be now borne in mind is this, that if the
cylinder <i>E</i> turns round, the plate <i>F</i> will also turn round, and
with it the stud <i>c</i>; and as this stud works into the peculiarly
formed cavity <i>d</i> in a portion of the bolt (<a href="#Fig38">fig. 38</a>), it causes the
bolt to be shot backwards or forwards. Now, in order to prevent
this rotating of the cylinder unless the proper key be employed,
the following mechanism is introduced: the cylinder
has a groove cut round its circumference at <i>e e</i>, extending sufficiently
near to the internal bore to produce the desired effect
without too much weakening the metal. Into this notch is introduced
the thin circular plate of metal <i>f f</i>, it being divided
into two halves for this purpose; and when so placed, it occupies
the position shewn by the dotted portion <i>e e</i>. When this plate
is screwed to the case of the lock by the screws 4, 4, it cannot
of course turn round; but the cylinder itself will or will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
turn round according to the position of the slides. The plate
<i>f f</i> has six notches, 5, 5, 5, &amp;c. in the inner edge or circle; so
adjusted that, when the plate is in its place, the slides <i>a a</i> can
move up and down. The cylinder cannot move round in a
circle without carrying the slides with it; and these cannot so
move unless they are all depressed to such exact distances in
their respective grooves, that the deep notch of each slider
(shewn at 2 in <a href="#Fig37">fig. 37</a>) shall come into the plane of the circular
plate: when all are so brought, the cylinder can be turned. If
any one of the slides be pressed down either too low or not low
enough, this turning of the cylinder cannot be effected, because
the slides will be intersected by the edges of the notches 5, 5;
and it is the office of the key, therefore, to press all the six
slides down to the exact distances required. When the slides
are not pressed upon by the key, they are forced upwards to
the top of the cylinder by a spiral spring 6, coiled loosely round
the pin <i>b</i>; this pressure forces up a small collet, 7, on which
the upper part of the slides rest by a sort of step.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig38">
<img src="images/illo078.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 38. The bolt.</p>
</div>

<p>The first locks were made with a separate and independent
spring to each slide; but it is a very great improvement, the
introduction of one common spring to raise up the whole
number; because if a person attempts to pick the lock by
depressing the slides separately by means of any small pointed
instruments, and by chance brings two or more of them to the
proper depth for turning round, should he press any one too
low, it is difficult to raise it again without relieving the
spring 6, which immediately throws the whole number of
slides up to the top, and destroys all that had been done
towards picking the lock. Another improvement of this lock,
and one which very much increased the difficulty of picking,
and its consequent security, was the introduction of false
and deceptive notches cut in the sliders, as seen at 3, 3. It
was found that in the attempt to pick this lock, an instrument
was introduced by the keyhole to force the cylinder round.
At the same time that the slides were depressed by separate
instruments, those slides which were not at the proper level<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
for moving round were held fast by the notches 5, 5 in the
plate <i>f f</i> bearing against their sides; but when pressed down
to the proper level, or till the notch 2 came opposite <i>f f</i>, they
were not held fast, but were relieved. This furnished the
depredator with the means of ascertaining which slides were
pressed low enough, or to the point for unlocking. The
notches 3, 3 in the slides are sometimes cut above the true
notch 2, sometimes below, and at other times one on each side
(one above and one below); they are not of sufficient depth to
allow the cylinder to turn round, but are intended to mislead
any one who attempts to pick, by his not knowing whether it
is the true notch or otherwise, or even whether the slider be
higher or lower than the true notch.</p>

<p>We have not yet sufficiently described the key of the
Bramah lock. One merit of the lock is the remarkable smallness
of the key, which renders it so conveniently portable. The
key, as shewn in the upper part of the figure, has six notches
or clefts at the end of its pipe or barrel; these clefts are cut to
different depths, to accord with the proper extent of movement
in the slides. There is a small projection, 10, near the end of
the pipe, fitted to enter the notch <span class="smcapall">D</span> in the cylinder; this forces
the cylinder round when the parts are all properly adjusted.
The bolt of the lock, when properly shot or locked, is prevented
from being forced back by the stud <i>c</i> on the bottom, <span class="smcapall">F</span>,
of the cylinder coming into a direct line with its centre of motion,
as shewn in <a href="#Fig39">fig. 39</a>; in this position no force, applied to
drive the bolt back, would have any tendency to turn the
cylinder round.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig39">
<img src="images/illo081.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 39. Section of the Bramah cylinder.</p>
</div>

<p>To facilitate the comprehension of this very curious and
beautiful mechanism, the cylinder is shewn in section in the
annexed <a href="#Fig39">fig. 39</a>, the same letters and figures of reference being
used as before. In the whole of this description we have
spoken of six slides, and six only; but Bramah locks may be,
and have been, constructed with a much larger number.</p>

<p>There have been several attempts made to modify the
action of Bramah’s lock, or to combine this action with that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
some other inventor. It will suffice to describe one of these.
The lock invented by Mr. Kemp of Cork, and for which a
patent was obtained in 1816, is called by him the <i>Union</i> lock,
as combining the principles of Barron’s and Bramah’s locks. It
contains two, three, or more sliders or tumblers, operated upon
by two, three, or more concentric tubes. These concentric
tubes are of different lengths, and are placed inside the barrel
of the key; so that the barrel may, in fact, be conceived to
consist of a series of concentric tubes. These tubes are made
of such respective lengths as to push back the tumblers,
sliders, or pins which detain the bolt; and this to the precise
extent that will bring certain notches in all the sliders to the
position which will allow the bolt to pass. The inventor gives
this lock its distinctive appellation because it combines something
of the pushing motion which Bramah gives to his key,
with something of the tumbler-motion observable in Barron’s
locks. The principle of safety is considered here to rest chiefly
on the extreme difficulty of imitating the key.</p>

<p>Mr. Bramah calculates the number of changes of position
which the slides of his lock are capable of assuming before the
right one would be attained. “Let us suppose the number
of levers, slides, or other movables by which the lock is kept
shut, to consist of twelve, all of which must receive a different
and distinct change in their position or situation by the application
of the key, and each of them likewise capable of receiving
more or less than its due, either of which would be sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
to prevent the intended effect. It remains, therefore, to
estimate the number producible, which maybe thus attempted.
Let the denomination of these slides be represented by twelve
arithmetical progressionals; we find that the ultimate number
of changes that may be made in their place or situation is
479,001,600; and by adding one more to that number of slides,
they would then be capable of receiving a number of changes
equal to 6,227,020,800; and so on progressively, by the addition
of others in like manner to infinity. From this it appears
that one lock, consisting of thirteen of the above-mentioned
sliders, may (by changing their places only, without any difference
in motion or size,) be made to require the said immense
number of keys, by which the lock could only be
opened under all its variations.”</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER VII.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">AMERICAN LOCKS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The lock-manufacture in America has undergone some such
changes as in England. The insufficiency of wards to the attainment
of security has been for many years known; and the
unfitness of even tumblers to attain this end, without auxiliary
contrivances, has been fully recognised for a dozen years back.
In this, and in other mechanical arts, the American machinists
depended primarily on the invention of the artisans in the
mother country, rather than on those of any continental European
state. But the development of the art in the United
States has not been wanting in originality; the varieties of
locks have been very numerous, and many of them exceedingly
ingenious. It is not necessary, however, to describe or depict
any of those of simple form. The warded locks of different
countries very much resemble each other; the intricate warded<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
locks made in France in the last century have long fallen into
disuse, in consequence of the general conviction that no arrangement
of wards, however intricate, can afford the degree of security
required in a good lock. It will be more to the purpose,
therefore, to proceed at once to a notice of those American locks
which, during the last few years, have acquired some celebrity;
first, however, noticing one of older date.</p>

<p>Stansbury’s lock, invented in the United States about forty
years ago, may be regarded as a modification of the Egyptian
lock. It had a bolt, case, and key-hole somewhat similar to
those of modern locks; but there were peculiarities of construction
in other respects. There was a revolving plate, pierced
with a series of holes, and having a bit or pin which moved
the bolt. On the lock-case were a series of springs, each
having a pin at one end; and the arrangement was such that,
when the bolt was locked or unlocked, each pin would be
pressed into some one of the holes. Like as in the Egyptian lock
(<a href="#Fig1">figs. 1</a> to <a href="#Fig4">4</a>), each pin had to be pushed out, and all of them
simultaneously, to allow the plate to turn and move the bolt.
The key was made with a barrel and bit; and on the front end
of the bit was a series of pins corresponding in position with
the holes in the plate. The mode of locking or unlocking was
as follows: the key was inserted in the key-hole, and turned
to a certain position; it was then pressed in with some force,
until the pins on the key met those in the plate; when the
latter, yielding to the pressure, left the plate free to turn and
move the bolt. Modifications of the Egyptian lock, more or
less resembling this, have been brought out in some variety on
both sides of the Atlantic; but scarcely any have equalled in
simplicity the curious wooden relic of by-gone ingenuity in the
art of lock-making.</p>

<p>A lock made a few years ago by Mr. Yale, in the United
States, somewhat resembles the Bramah lock in having a cylinder
or barrel, or rather two concentric cylinders, one working
within the other. These cylinders are held together by pins
which pass through them both into the key-hole. On the back<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
of the inner cylinder is a pin that fits into a slot in the bolt,
and moves it whenever the cylinder is turned. The pins that
hold the cylinders together are each cut in two; the pieces of
the various pins differing in lengths as irregularly as possible.
The key is so peculiarly formed, that, on inserting it in the
key-hole, it thrusts the pins radially outwards; each pin being
pushed just so far that the joint of the pin shall coincide with
the joint between the two cylinders. The inner cylinder can
then be turned, by which the bolt is locked or unlocked. If,
by the use of a false key, any pin be pushed in too far, it will
be as ineffectual in opening the lock as if it were not thrust in
far enough; and some of these locks having been made with as
many as forty pins, the chances are very numerous against the
right combination being hit upon. There is a combination of
something like the Egyptian with something like the Bramah
lock, here attempted.</p>

<p>One of the principal constructions adopted in America
a few years back for bank-locks is that of Dr. Andrews of
Perth Amboy, in New Jersey. It was up to that time (1841)
believed that the best locks, both of England and America,
were proof against any attempts at picking derived from knowledge
obtained by inspection through the key-hole; but there
still remained the danger that the sight of the true key, or the
possession thereof, for only a few minutes, would enable a dishonest
person to produce a duplicate. It was to contend against
this difficulty that Dr. Andrews directed his attention; and he
sought to obtain the desired object by constructing a lock, the
interior mechanism of which could be changed at pleasure.
The lock of his invention is furnished with a series of tumblers
and a detector. The tumblers are susceptible of being arranged
in any desired order; and the key has movable bits which can
be arranged so as to correspond with the tumblers. When the
lock is fixed in its place, no change can be made in the tumblers,
and consequently only one arrangement of the bits of the
key will suit for the shooting and withdrawing of the bolt.
The owner can, however, before the fixing of the bolt, adopt<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
any arrangement of tumblers and bits which he may choose.
But though the tumblers cannot be actually re-arranged in any
new order within the lock while the latter is fixed, yet by an
ingenious contrivance the tumblers can be so acted upon as to
render the lock practically different from its former self. The
purchaser receives with his lock a series of small steel rings,
each ring corresponds in thickness with the thickness of some
one of the bits of the key; so that, by suitable adjustment, any
one of the bits may be removed from the key, and a ring be
substituted in its place. The effect of this substitution is, that
the particular tumbler which corresponds with the ring is not
raised by it; it is drawn out with the bolt, as if it were part of
the bolt itself. Supposing the lock to be locked by this means,
the original key would not now unlock it; for one of the tumblers
has now been displaced, and can only be re-adjusted by
the same ring which displaced it. If an attempt be made to
open the lock by the original key, or by the key in its original
adjustment, a detector is set in action, which indicates that a
false key or other instrument has been put into the lock. One,
or more than one, of the bits may be removed from the key,
and rings be substituted, and consequently one or more of the
tumblers may be disturbed in this peculiar way; so that the
lock may change its character in all those permutating varieties
which are so observable in most “safety-locks.” The
shape of the tumblers is, of course, such as to facilitate this
action; they have each an elongated slot, and also two notches;
when a tumbler is raised by one of the bits of the key, one of
the notches closes around a stump fitted into the case of the
lock, and prevents the tumbler from being moved onward with
the bolt; but when a ring has been substituted for a bit on
the key, the tumbler cannot be raised at all; it is carried onward
by a stump on the bolt.</p>

<p>Dr. Andrews is also the inventor of a lock which he terms
the <i>snail-wheel lock</i>. In this lock a series of revolving discs,
or wheels, taking the place of the tumblers, are mounted on a
central pin, on which the pipe of the key is inserted. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
disc has a piece cut out of it, into which the bit of the key
enters, and in turning round moves the discs according to the
various lengths of the steps on the key. On the outer edge of
each disc is a notch, and by the turning of the key all these
notches are brought into a line, so that a moveable tongue, or
<i>toggle</i>, attached to the bolt, falls into the notches; the key is
then turned the reverse way, by which means the bolt is
projected.</p>

<p>About the time when Dr. Andrews invented his first lock,
Mr. Newell, of the firm of Day and Newell of New York, constructed
a lock which possessed the same distinctive peculiarity
as that of Andrews, viz. that the key might be altered any number
of times without rendering it necessary to remove the lock
or change its internal mechanism. This was brought about,
however, in a different manner. Instead of having, as in the
Andrews lock, a two-fold movement to every tumbler, Mr.
Newell employed two sets of tumblers, the one set to receive
motion from the other, and having different offices to fill, to
be acted upon by the key in respect to the first series, and to
act upon the bolt in respect to the second. Calling these two
sets <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i>, the action of the lock may be briefly
described as follows. A primary tumbler being raised to the
proper height by the proper bit in the key, raises the corresponding
secondary tumbler; the secondary tumbler is held
up in a given position during the locking, while the primary
becomes pressed by a spring into its original position. It results
from this arrangement that the bolt cannot be unlocked
until the primary tumbler has been raised to the same height
as before, so as to receive the tongue of the secondary tumbler.
And as this is the case in respect to any one primary and its
accompanying secondary tumblers, so is it the case whether
each set comprises four, five, or any other number. The key
may be altered at pleasure, and will in any form equally well
shoot the bolt; but the lock can only be unfastened by that
arrangement of key which fastened it.</p>

<p>It is, however, desirable to trace the course of improvements<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
more in detail, because every successive change illustrates
one or other of the several properties required in a good
lock. Messrs. Day and Newell’s lock was not finally brought
to an efficient form without many attempts more or less abortive.
Mr. Newell conceived the idea of applying a second
series of tumblers, so placed as to be acted on by the first
series. Each of these secondary tumblers had an elongated
slot, such that a screw could pass through all of them; the
screw having a clamp to overlap the tumblers on the inside
of the lock. The head of the screw rested in a small round
hole on the back of the lock, so placed as to form a secondary
key-hole, to which a small key was fitted. There was thus a
double system of locking, effected in the following way: when
the large key had been applied, and had begun to act on the
primary tumblers, the small key was used to operate on the
clamp-screw, and thus bind all of the secondary tumblers together,
ensuring their position at the exact heights or distances
to which the primary key had caused them to be lifted.
The bolt was then free to be shot, and the first series of tumblers
reverted to their original position.</p>

<p>But such an arrangement has obvious inconveniences.
Few persons would incur the trouble of using two keys;
and besides this, there were not wanting certain defects in
the action and reaction of the several parts; for if the clamp-screw
were to be left unreleased, the first series of tumblers
would be upheld by the second series in such a way that
the exact impression of the lengths of the several bits of the
key could be obtained through the key-hole while the lock was
unlocked or the bolt unshot. To remedy one or both of these
evils was the next object of Mr. Newell’s attention. He made
a series of notches or teeth in each of the secondary tumblers,
corresponding in mutual distance with the steps or bits of the
key; and opposite these notched edges he placed a dog or
lever, with a projecting tooth suitable to fall into the notches
when adjusted properly in relation to each other. When the
key was used, the primary tumblers were raised in the usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
way, and acted on the secondary tumblers; these latter were
so thrown that the dog-tooth caught in the notches and held
them fast, thereby rendering the same service as the clamp-screw
and the small key in the former arrangement. No other
relative position of the bits of the key could now unlock the
lock.</p>

<p>Still, improvement as it was, this change was not enough;
Mr. Newell found that his lock, like all the locks that had preceded
it, was capable of being picked by a clever practitioner;
and candidly admitting the fact, he sought to obtain some new
means of security. He tried what a series of complicated
wards would do, in aid of the former mechanism; but the
result proved unsatisfactory. His next principle was to provide
a number of false notches on the abutting parts of the
primary and secondary tumblers, with alterations in other parts
of the apparatus. The theory now depended upon was this,
that if the bolt were subjected to pressure, the tumblers would
be held fast by false notches, and could not be raised by
any lock-picking instrument. To increase the security, a
steel-curtain was so adjusted as to cover, or at least protect,
the key-hole. Great anticipations were entertained of this lock,
but they were destined to be negatived. A clever American
machinist, Mr. Pettit, accepted Messrs. Day and Newell’s challenge
(500 dollars to any one who could pick this lock); he
succeeded in picking the lock, and thus won the prize.</p>

<p>Once again disappointed, Mr. Newell re-examined the whole
affair, and sought for some new principle of security that had
not before occurred to him. He had found that, modify his
lock how he might, the sharp-eyed and neat-fingered mechanician
could still explore the interior of the lock in such a
way as to find out the relative positions of the tumblers, and
thus adapt their means to the desired end. How, therefore, to
shut out this exploration altogether became the problem; how
to make a lock, the works of which should be <i>parautoptic</i>&mdash;to
coin a word from the Greek, which should signify <i>concealed
from view</i>. The result of his labours was the production of<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
the American bank-lock now known by that name. The details
of this lock may now conveniently be given.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig40">fig. 40</a> the lock is represented in its unlocked state, with
the cover or top-plate removed; the auxiliary tumbler and the
detector-plate are also removed. In <a href="#Fig41">fig. 41</a> it is represented as
locked, with the cover and the detector-plate also removed, and
the auxiliary tumbler in its place. In these two figures, the
same letters of reference apply to the same parts, unless otherwise
stated. <span class="smcapall">B B</span> is the bolt; <span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>1</sup> are the first series of movable
slides or tumblers; <i>s</i> shews the tumbler-springs; <span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>2</sup> the
secondary series of tumblers; and <span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>3</sup> the third or intermediate
series&mdash;these latter coming between the first and secondary
series; <span class="smcapall">P P</span> are the separating plates between the several members
of the first series of tumblers; <i>s</i><sup>1</sup> are the springs for lifting
the intermediate tumblers. On each of the secondary tumblers
<span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>2</sup> is a series of notches, corresponding in mutual distance with
the difference in the lengths of the movable bits of the key.
It thence happens that, when the key is turned in the lock to
lock it, each bit raises its proper tumbler, so that some one
of these notches shall present itself in front of the tooth <i>t</i> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
the dog or lever <span class="smcapall">L L</span>. When the bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span> is projected by the action
of the key, it carries with it the secondary tumblers <span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>2</sup>, and
presses the tooth <i>t</i> into the notches; in so doing, it withdraws
the tongues <i>d</i> from between the jaws <i>j j</i> of the intermediate
tumblers <span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>3</sup>, and allows the first and intermediate tumblers to
fall to their original position. By the same movement, the
secondary tumblers <span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>2</sup> become held in the position given to
them by the key, by means of the tooth <i>t</i> being pressed into
the several notches, as shewn in the closed state of the lock
(<a href="#Fig41">fig. 41</a>). Now let us see what results if any attempt be made
to open the lock with any arrangement of key but that by
which it has been locked. In such case, the tongues <i>d</i> will
abut against the jaws <i>j j</i>, preventing the bolt from being withdrawn;
and should an attempt be made to ascertain which
tumbler binds and requires to be moved, the intermediate tumbler
<span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>3</sup> (which receives the pressure), being behind the iron
wall <span class="smcapall">I I</span>, which is fixed completely across the lock, prevents the
possibility of its being reached through the key-hole; and the
first tumblers <span class="smcapall">T</span> are quite detached at the time, thereby making<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
it impossible to ascertain the position of the parts in the inner
chamber behind the wall <span class="smcapall">I I</span>. <span class="smcapall">K</span> is the drill-pin, on which the
key fits; and <span class="smcapall">C</span> is a revolving ring or curtain, which turns
round with the key, and prevents the possibility of inspecting
the interior of the lock through the key-hole. Should, however,
this ring be turned to bring the opening upwards, a detector-plate
<span class="smcapall">D</span>, <a href="#Fig42">fig. 42</a>, is immediately carried over the key-hole by the motion
of a pin <i>p</i><sup>1</sup> upon the auxiliary tumbler <span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>4</sup>, which is lifted by
the revolution of the ring <span class="smcapall">C</span>, thereby effectually closing the key-hole.
As an additional protection, the bolt is held from being
unlocked by the stud or stump <span class="smcapall">S</span> bearing against the detector-plate;
and, moreover, the lever <i>l l</i> holds the bolt, when locked,
until it is released by the tail of the detector-plate pressing the
pin <i>p</i><sup>1</sup>; <i>l</i><sup>1</sup> is a lever which holds the bolt on the upper side,
when locked, until it is lifted by the tumblers acting on the
pin <i>p</i><sup>1</sup>; <span class="smcapall">X</span> are separating-plates between the intermediate tumblers
<span class="smcapall">T</span><sup>3</sup>; <i>u u</i><sup>1</sup> are the studs for preserving the parallel motion
of the different tumblers.</p>

<p>In 1847 the parautoptic lock was exhibited at Vienna before
the National Mechanics’ Institute of Lower Austria; and
towards the close of the year Mr. Belmont, consul-general of
Austria at New York, placed in the hands of Messrs. Day and
Newell a letter, a diploma, and a gold medal, forwarded by the
Institute. The letter was from the president of the Institute to
Mr. Newell, and was couched in the following terms:</p>

<p>“The Institute of Lower Austria, at its last monthly session,
has passed the unanimous resolution to award to you its gold
medal, as an acknowledgment of the uncommon superiority of
the combination-lock of your invention; and this resolution was
ratified in its general convention held on the 10th instant.</p>

<p>“Whilst I, as president of this Institute, rejoice in seeing
the services which by this invention you have rendered to the
locksmith’s art thus appreciated and recognised, I transmit to
you, enclosed, the said medal, together with the documents relating<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
to it; at the same time availing myself of this opportunity
to assure you of my esteem.</p>

<p class="right padr2">“<span class="smcap">Colloredo Mannsfeld.</span></p>

<p>“Vienna, May 31st, 1847.”</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">The diploma and the medal were similar to other honorary
distinctions of the same class, and need not be described here;
but the report of the special committee may be given, as it expresses
the opinions of the Viennese machinists on the relative
principles by which safety is sought to be obtained in different
kinds of locks.</p>

<p class="center highline2 gesp2">REPORT</p>

<div class="report">

<p class="hind02"><i>Of a Special Committee on the new Parautoptic Permutation Lock of the
American Newell, made known to the Lower Austrian Institute by the
Councillor, Professor Reuter, and on the motions relating to it made by
the same and accepted by the Institute. Presented at the monthly meeting,
April 6th, 1847, by Mr. Paul Sprenger, Aulic Councillor on Public
Works, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="blankbefore75"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;At our last monthly meeting, Mr. Reuter, Aulic Councillor
and Secretary of the Institute, directed your attention to a newly
invented lock of Mr. Newell, of North America, which was represented as
excelling all other changeable combination-locks hitherto known, and as
being without a rival.</p>

<p>The Special Committee which was intrusted with the examination of
this lock, and of the motions made by the said Secretary, and accepted by
the Institute, has conferred on me the honour of making you acquainted
with the results of its investigations.</p>

<p>The attention of your committee was chiefly occupied with the three
questions proposed by the said Aulic Councillor in relation to the lock in
question:</p>

<p>First: Whether the idea of Mr. Newell was of any practical value for
already existing and still-to-be-invented combination-locks;</p>

<p>Secondly: Whether the idea was of sufficient importance to be published
and minutely described in the transactions of the said Institute; and</p>

<p>Thirdly: Whether the merits of the inventor were of sufficient importance
to entitle him to a distinction from the said Institute.</p>

<p>The deliberations on the first question, viz. the newness of the idea, and
of its practical value, would of necessity enlist the particular attention of
your committee, especially since by far the greater number of its members
are by their avocation called upon to be interested in the execution of all
kinds of locks.</p>

<p>It is therefore the unanimous opinion of your committee, that the idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
of the American Parautoptic Combination-Lock is entirely new and without
example.</p>

<p>The combination-locks with keys have, with few exceptions, such an
arrangement that a determinate number of movable parts (the so-called
combination-parts) must by the turning of the key be raised or lifted into
a certain position, if it is desired to project the bolt, or, what is the same
thing, to lock it out; consequently these parts, or, as they are technically
termed, tumblers, could not be transposed or changed, from the circumstance
that the key-bit was one solid piece, with various steps or notches
adapted to the several tumblers, and one impression from it destroyed the
security of the lock.</p>

<p>In order, however, to add more security to such a combination-lock,
and to make the key, in case it should be lost, or any counterfeit made from
a wax impression, useless for an unlawful opening of the lock, another step
was taken: the key-bit was made to consist of several bits or movable parts,
in such a manner that the owner of the lock was enabled to change the
bits, and to form, <i>as it were</i>, new keys different from the former. But since
the bolt of the lock can only be projected whilst the combination parts or
tumblers are in a certain position, which position depends upon the order
of the bits in the key, it is evident that the owner, when changing the key,
must at the same time make a corresponding change in the position of the
tumblers in the lock itself, before the lock can be of any use for the newly
changed shape of the key, which rendered it troublesome, and impracticable
for the purpose designed, from the fact that no positive change could be
made in the lock, without taking it from the door, and then taking the
tumblers out of the case, to change them in a suitable form for the key.</p>

<p>This principle of changing the lock is rarely adhered to, as few men
understand the machinery of a lock sufficiently to undertake the task; and
this circumstance rendered the lock quite as insecure as the former one
described.</p>

<p>Another step toward the perfection of combination-locks consisted in
this, that the key remains unaltered whilst the combination parts of the
lock can, before it is locked, be brought into different positions by means of
movable plates on the frame of the lock. These plates were arranged by
hand to certain figures, and depended on the memory for adjustment at
each time the bolt was to be locked out or in, the key operating only on the
bolt, to move it back and forth when the plates were set in proper positions
for the purpose; and should the owner forget the arrangement of the
plates, after projecting the bolt, his key is of no use to him, and he must
resort to the skill of the locksmith to gain access.</p>

<p>The same case may occur in the far less perfect ring-lock of Reynier,
which is operated without keys, and is opened by means of the rings being
turned in a particular position; on these rings are usually stamped letters,
which, by introducing some word readily suggested to the memory, thus
point out the relative position of the rings.</p>

<p>But although in case of these ring-locks the owner is enabled to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
a change in the rings in such a manner that the opening of the lock can, as
it were, only become possible by rightly arranging the altered position of
the letters, still this lock of Reynier’s does not possess that safety and perfection
which could have insured it universal application.</p>

<p>M. Crivelli, formerly professor at Milan, has given a minute description
of the imperfection of ring-locks generally, in the annals of the Imperial
Royal Polytechnic Institute.</p>

<p>It is the unanimous conviction of your committee that the American
Lock of Newell surpasses, in the ingenuity displayed in its construction, all
other locks heretofore known, and more especially in this, that the owner
can, with the greatest facility, change at pleasure the interior arrangement
of his lock to a new and more complex one, at every moment of his life,
simply by altering the arrangement of the bits in the key, and this is accomplished
without removing the lock or any part of it from its position on
the door.</p>

<p>Its operation is as follows:&mdash;At the closing or locking of the lock, whilst
the bolt is projecting, the movable combination parts assume precisely the
position prescribed to them by the key, according to the particular arrangement
of its bits at the time the key is turned.</p>

<p>The combination parts do not consist in one set of tumblers only, such
as are found in all other locks, but there are three distinct sets or component
parts fitting into each other. When the bolt is projected, it dissolves
the mutual connexion of the constituent pieces, and carries along with it
such as are designedly attached to it, and which assume the particular
positions given them by the key in its revolution. These parts are rendered
permanent in their given form by means of a lever adapted for the purpose,
while the parts not united with the bolt are pressed down by their springs
to their original places.</p>

<p>If now the bolt is to be returned again, <i>i. e.</i> if the lock is to be unlocked,
then the constituent pieces or tumblers which are in the original state must,
by means of the key, be again raised into that position in which they were
when the lock was closed, as otherwise the constituent parts attached to
the bolt would not lock in with the former, and the bolt could not be returned.
Nothing, therefore, but the precise key which had locked the lock
can effect the object.</p>

<p>This idea in itself, considered by your committee, is as ingenious as it is
new, and is accompanied by a perfection in its execution which reflects the
highest honour on Mr. Newell, the inventor and manufacturer of the lock.</p>

<p>The lock is built strong and solid, and the several parts are admirably
adapted to the functions which they are designed to perform. The walls
of steel or iron which separate the security parts from the tumblers, and
the cylinder which revolves with the key, present formidable barriers to all
descriptions of pick-locks, and render the lock a most positive and reliable
security. The tumblers consist of rolled very smooth steel plates, in which
the fire-crust has not been filed away, partly in order that the lock might
not need oiling, as all these parts are very smooth, and partly that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
combination pieces might not easily rust, a thing to which the adhering
fire-crust is not favourable. The springs, which by the turning of the key
must be raised together with the tumblers, are attached to levers, and
press upon the latter at their centre of gravity, in consequence of which all
crowding towards either side is prevented, and the key can be turned with
facility, in spite of the many combination parts which it has to raise; and
the springs themselves are by their positions so little called into action,
that their strength can never be impaired by use.</p>

<p>The lock has also another very complete arrangement in the detector-tumbler,
which is attached to the cap or covering of the lock. This tumbler,
on turning the key either way, closes the key-hole, and not only prevents
the use of false instruments in the lock, but detects all attempts at
mutilating its interior parts.</p>

<p>This lock is especially useful for locking bank-vaults, magazines, counting-houses,
and iron-safes, in which valuable effects, money, or goods are
to be deposited for safe keeping. When it is considered that the bits of
the key belonging to this lock can be transferred into every possible form
within its limits, and since the construction of the lock admits of every
combination of the slides resulting from the changes of the key, therefore
the lock in question is, in every respect, deserving of the appellation given
to it by the Secretary of the Institute, namely, the Universal Combination
Lock; and justly so, when we consider that the ten bits attached to the
key admit of three millions of permutations, and upward; consequently
forming that number of different kinds of keys and locks.</p>

<p>If we consider further, that we need not be limited to the given bit, but
that others can be applied, differing in their dimensions from the former;
and again, if we consider that from every system arising from a difference
in their relative dimensions, a large number of new keys differing from each
other will result, and that this can be effected in a space scarcely occupying
a square inch,&mdash;then we cannot refrain from confessing that the human
mind, within this small space, has shewn itself to be infinitely great.</p>

<p>After this preliminary and general exposition, your committee can
answer the three questions propounded to them the more briefly, as the
locks heretofore known have all been noticed.</p>

<p>To question first.&mdash;On the practical value of the invention of Mr. Newell,
your committee were unanimous and positive that the principle on which it
is based should be preserved.</p>

<p>To question second.&mdash;For this reason the committee deemed it desirable
that a drawing and description of the American lock in question should be
published in the Transactions of the Institute of Lower Austria.</p>

<p>To question third.&mdash;With regard to the claims of the inventor, Mr.
Newell, to an honorary distinction from the Institute of Lower Austria, the
committee recommend that he be presented with a Diploma of honourable
mention and a Gold Medal.</p>

<p>The members of your committee, consisting mostly of fellow-tradesmen
of Mr. Newell, experience great satisfaction in the fact that it has fallen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
their lot to vote to their colleague on the other side of the ocean an acknowledgment
of his successful ingenuity, and they close the Report with the
request that the Institute will transmit to Mr. Newell of New York, in
North America, the Diploma and Gold Medal, together with a copy of this
Report, according to the motion of the Aulic Councillor and Professor
Reuter.</p>

<p>There are other circumstances connected with the American
bank-lock, in relation to events both in the United States
and in England, to which attention will be directed in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p>The English patent for Messrs. Day and Newell’s lock,
dated April 15, 1851, runs as follows: “The object of the
present improvements is the constructing of locks in such
manner that the interior arrangements, or the combination of
the internal movable parts, may be changed at pleasure according
to the form given to, or change made in, the key, without
the necessity of arranging the movable parts of the lock by
hand, or removing the lock or any part thereof from the door.
In locks constructed on this plan the key may be altered at
pleasure; and the act of locking, or throwing out the bolt of
the lock, produces the particular arrangement of the internal
parts which corresponds to that of the key for the time being.
While the same is locked, this form is retained until the lock
is unlocked or the bolt withdrawn, upon which the internal
movable parts return to their original position with reference
to each other; but these parts cannot be made to assume or be
brought back to their original position, except by a key of the
precise form and dimensions as the key by which they were
made to assume such arrangement in the act of locking. The
key is changeable at pleasure, and the lock receives a special
form in the act of locking according to the key employed, and
retains that form until in the act of unlocking by the same
key it resumes its original or unlocked state. The lock is<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
again changeable at pleasure, simply by altering the arrangement
of the movable bits of the key; and the key may be
changed to any one of the forms within the number of permutations
of which the parts are susceptible.”</p>

<p>The “claims” put forth under this patent are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. The constructing, by means of a first and secondary
series of slides or tumblers, of a changeable lock, in which the
particular form or arrangement of parts of the lock, imparted
by the key to the first and secondary series of slides or tumblers,
is retained by a cramp-plate.</p>

<p>“2. The constructing, by means of a first and secondary
series of slides or tumblers, of a changeable lock, in which
the peculiar form or arrangement of parts of the lock, imparted
by the key, is retained by means of a tooth or teeth,
and notches on the secondary series of slides or tumblers.</p>

<p>“3. The application to locks of a third or intermediate
series of slides or tumblers.</p>

<p>“4. The application of a dog with a pin over-lapping the
slide or tumblers, for the purpose of holding-in the bolt when
the lock is locked or unlocked.</p>

<p>“5. The application of a dog operated on by the cap or
detector-tumbler for holding the bolt.</p>

<p>“6. The application of a dog for the purpose of holding
the internal slide or tumbler.</p>

<p>“7. The application to locks of curtains or rings, turning
and working eccentrically to the motion of the key, for
preventing access to the internal parts of the lock.</p>

<p>“8. The application to locks of a safety-plug or yielding-plate,
at the back of the chamber formed by such eccentric revolving
curtain or ring.</p>

<p>“9. The application to locks of a strong metallic wall or
plate, for the purpose of separating the safety and other parts
of the lock from each other, and preventing access to such
parts by means of the key-hole.</p>

<p>“10. The application to locks of a cap or detective tumbler,<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
for the purpose of closing the key-hole as the key is
turned.</p>

<p>“11. The constructing a key by a combination of bits or
movable pieces, with tongues fitted into a groove and held by
a screw.</p>

<p>“12. The constructing a key having a groove in its shank
to receive the detector tumbler.”</p>

<p>When the American locks became known in England, Mr.
Hobbs undertook the superintendence of their manufacture,
and their introduction into the commercial world. Such a
lock as that just described must necessarily be a complex
piece of mechanism; it is intended for use in the doors of receptacles
containing property of great value; and the aim has
been to baffle all the methods at present known of picking
locks, by a combination of mechanism necessarily elaborate.
Such a lock must of necessity be costly; but in order to supply
the demand for a small lock at moderate price, Mr. Hobbs has
introduced what he calls a <i>protector lock</i>. This is a modification
of the ordinary six-tumbler lock. It bears an affinity to
the lock of Messrs. Day and Newell, inasmuch as it is an
attempt to introduce the same principle of security against
picking, while avoiding the complexity of the changeable lock.
The distinction which Mr. Hobbs has made between secure
and insecure locks will be understood from the following
proposition, viz. “that whenever the parts of a lock which
come in contact with the key are so affected by any pressure
applied to the bolt, or to that portion of the lock by which
the bolt is withdrawn, as to indicate the points of resistance to
the withdrawal of the bolt, such a lock can be picked.”
<a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a> exhibits the internal mechanism of this new patent
lock. It contains the usual contrivances of tumblers and
springs, with a key cut into steps to suit the
different heights to which the tumblers must be
raised. The key is shewn separately in <a href="#Fig48">fig. 48</a>.
But there is a small additional piece of mechanism,
in which the <i>tumbler stump</i> shewn at <i>s</i> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
<a href="#Fig46">figs. 46</a> and <a href="#Fig47">47</a> is attached; which piece is intended to work under
or behind the bolt of the lock. In <a href="#Fig47">fig. 47</a>, <i>b</i> is the bolt; <i>t t</i> is
the front or foremost of the range of six tumblers,
each of which has the usual slot and notches. In
other tumbler-locks the stump or stud which
moves along these slots is riveted to the bolt, in
such manner that, if any pressure be applied in an
attempt to withdraw the bolt, the stump becomes
pressed against the edges of the tumblers, and
bites or binds against them. How far their biting
facilitates the picking of a lock will be shewn further
on; but it will suffice here to say, that the
movable action given to the stump in the Hobbs
lock transfers the pressure to another quarter.
The stump <i>s</i> is riveted to a peculiarly-shaped
piece of metal <i>h h</i> (<a href="#Fig46">fig. 46</a>), the hole in the centre of
which fits upon a centre or pin in a recess formed at the back
of the bolt; the piece moves easily on its centre, but is prevented
from so doing spontaneously by a small binding spring.
The mode in which this small movable piece takes part in the
action of the lock is as follows: when the proper key is applied
in the usual way, the tumblers are all raised to the proper heights
for allowing the stump to pass horizontally through the gating;
but should there be an attempt made, either by a false key or by
any other instrument, to withdraw the bolt before the tumblers
are properly raised, the stump becomes an obstacle. Meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
with an obstruction to its passage, the stump turns the piece to
which it is attached on its centre, and moves the arm of the
piece <i>p</i> so that it shall come into contact with a stud riveted
into the case of the lock; and in this position there is a firm
resistance against the withdrawal of the bolt. The tumblers
are at the same moment released from the pressure of the
stump. There is a dog or lever <i>d</i>, which catches into the top
of the bolt, and thereby serves as an additional security
against its being forced back. At <i>k</i> is the drill-pin on which
the pipe of the key works; and <i>r</i> is a metal piece on which
the tumblers rest when the key is not operating upon them.</p>

<p>Another lock, patented by Mr. Hobbs in 1852, has for its
object the absolute closing of the key-hole during the process
of locking. The key does not work or turn on its own centre,
but occupies a small cell or chamber in a revolving cylinder,
which is turned by a fixed handle. The bit of the movable
key is entirely separable from the shaft or stem, into which
it is screwed, and may be detached by turning round a
small milled headed thumb-screw. The key is placed in
the key-hole in the usual way, but it cannot turn; its circular
movement round the stem as an axis is prevented by
the internal mechanism of the lock; it is left in the key-hole,
and the stem is detached from it by unscrewing. By turning
the handle, the key-bit, which is left in the chamber of the
cylinder, is brought into contact with the works of the lock, so
as to shoot and withdraw the bolt. This revolution may
take place whether the bit of the movable key occupy its
little cell in the plate or not; only with this difference&mdash;that
if the bit be <i>not</i> in the lock, the plate revolves without acting
upon any of the tumblers; but if the bit be in its place, it
raises the tumblers in the proper way for shooting or withdrawing
the bolt. It will be understood that there is only one
key-hole, namely, that through which the divisible key is inserted;
the other handle or fixed key working through a hole
in the cover of the lock only just large enough to receive it,
and not being removable from the lock. As soon as the plate<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
turns round so far as to enable the key-bit to act upon the
tumblers, the key-hole becomes entirely closed by the plate
itself, so that the actual locking is effected at the very time
when all access to the interior through the key-hole is cut off.
When the bolt has been shot, the plate comes round to its original
position, it uncovers the key-hole, and exhibits the key-bit
occupying the little cell into which it had been dropped;
the stem is then to be screwed into the bit, and the latter
withdrawn. It is one consequence of this arrangement, that
the key has to be screwed and unscrewed when used; but
through this arrangement the key-hole becomes a sealed book
to one who has not the right key. Nothing can be moved,
provided the bit and stem of the key be both left in; but by
leaving in the lock the former without the latter, the plate can
rotate, the tumblers can be lifted, and the bolt can be shot.</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER VIII.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE LOCK CONTROVERSY: PREVIOUS TO THE DATE OF THE GREAT
EXHIBITION.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">It must be evident, even on a cursory glance at the past history
of the lock-manufacture, that the prime motive for the
introduction of novelties and improvements in construction is
the desirability of producing a lock which no one can open
without the proper key. From the earliest and simplest lock,
down to the latest and most complex, this object has been
constantly held in view; and every clear proof or evidence
that this object has not been attained has led to the invention
of some new contrivance. It has been a succession of struggles&mdash;to
attain security&mdash;to shew that this security has not been
attained&mdash;to make a further and more ingenious attempt&mdash;to
detect the weak point in this renewed attempt&mdash;and so on.
We need not repeat here, what was stated in an early chapter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
that benefit must ultimately result from a candid discussion of
this question. When M. Réaumur proposed to explain how
the locks of his day could be picked or opened without the
true key, his object was to shew to persons who were not locksmiths
how far they could depend upon the principle of security
offered by locks. But before proceeding on his inquiry, the
illustrious naturalist asks, “Ne craindra-t-on pas que nous ne
donnions en même tems des leçons aux voleurs?” And he replies,
“Il n’y a pas grande apparence qu’ils viennent les chercher
ici, et qu’ils en aient besoin; ils sont plus grands maîtres
que nous dans l’art d’ouvrir les portes. Apprenons donc l’art
d’ouvrir les portes fermées, afin d’apprendre celui de les fermer
d’une manière qui ne laisse rien ou qui laisse peu à
craindre.”<a id="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

“But is there not this danger, that at the same time we shall be
giving lessons to the thieves? It is not very probable that they will seek
instruction of us, or that they have any need of it; they are greater masters
in the art of opening doors than we can pretend to be. Let us then learn the
art of opening locked doors, in order that we may acquire that of securing
them in such a way as to leave little or nothing to be feared on account of
their security.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Before treating of lock controversies and lock violability in
England, it will be desirable first to refer to America, where
this subject attracted much attention some years earlier than
the Great Exhibition&mdash;an Exhibition which will always be
associated in a remarkable manner with the history of locks.</p>

<p>Soon after the inventions by Dr. Andrews and Mr. Newell,
in 1841 (described in a former chapter), the rivalry between
the two locks ran high; each lock being ‘unpickable,’ according
to the estimate of its inventor. Mr. Newell thought the
best mode of shewing the superiority of his own lock would
be by picking that of his competitor; and after several trials,
he succeeded in bringing into practical application that system
of picking which we may designate the <i>mechanical</i>, as contra-distinguished
from the <i>arithmetical</i>. Mr. Newell not only picked
Dr. Andrews’ lock, but he wound up the enterprise by picking
his own! He was probably the first person who honestly confessed
to having picked his own unpickable lock. This discovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
led Mr. Newell, as has been noticed in a former page,
to the invention of the triple-action or parautoptic lock.</p>

<p>The mechanical principle, as applied to the picking of a
tumbler lock, is nearly the same whatever form of construction
be made the medium of experiment. When a pressure is applied
to the bolt sufficient to unlock it if the tumbler-obstructions
were removed, the edges of the tumbler bite or bind
against the stump of the bolt, so as not to move up and down
with such facility as under ordinary circumstances. By carefully
trying with a small instrument each tumbler, and moving
it until the bite ceases, the gating of that particular tumbler
may be brought to the exact position for allowing the stump
of the bolt to pass through it. (See <a href="#Page118">page 118</a>.)</p>

<p>This violability is observable in the tumbler-locks under
very varied forms of construction. Mr. Newell, after he had
picked his own lock, devised a series of complicated wards, to
add to the difficulty of reaching the tumblers; but he could
not thereby get rid of the importance of this fact, that wherever
a key can go, instruments of a suitable size and form
could follow: his wards did not render his lock inviolable.
His next contrivance was to notch the abutting parts of the
primary and secondary tumblers, or the face of the stump and
the ends of the tumblers; but this failed also. Mr. H. C. Jones,
of Newark, N. J., added to all this a revolving pipe and
curtain, to close as much of the key-hole as possible. But
so far were all these precautions from being successful, that a
lock provided with all these appendages, and affixed to the
door of the United States Treasury at Washington, was picked.
The makers of locks have, each one for himself, contended
against such difficulties as were known to them at the time of
inventing their locks; and, mortifying as failure may be, it
would be cowardly to yield up the enterprise whenever any
new difficulty presented itself. Difficulties, in locks as in other
matters, are made to be conquered.</p>

<p>To shew how numerous are the sources of insecurity
which have to be guarded against, to meet the skill often<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
brought to bear upon this lock, we may adduce the reasons
which led Mr. Newell to apply a curtain to the key-hole of his
lock. Supposing the interior arrangement of the triple set of
tumblers, and the metallic shielding wall, to be perfect, still,
<i>if the first set of tumblers can be seen through the key-hole</i>, the
following plan may be put in operation. The under-side of
the tumblers may be <i>smoked</i>, by inserting a flame through
the key-hole; and the key will then leave a distinct mark
upon each tumbler the next time it is used, shewing where it
began to touch each tumbler in lifting it. This may be seen
by inserting a small mirror hinged into the lock through the
key-hole. There may even be an electric light used from a
small portable battery, to illumine the interior of the lock.
By these and other means the exact length of each bit of the
key may be determined; and from these data a false key may
be made. It is to prevent this inspection of the works, or any
other examination of an analogous kind, that the revolving
curtain was applied; but, as stated in the last paragraph, even
this did not suffice: ingenuity devised a mode of baffling the
contrivance of curtains as well as that of the wards and false
notches in the tumblers.</p>

<p>When the parautoptic lock was completed, it was keenly
criticised in America, owing to the long discussions respecting
the merits of previous locks. In a matter of this kind, where
a commercial motive would lead bankers and companies to
apply a very severe test to the security of locks and similar
fastenings to strong-rooms and receptacles, any experiments
made with their sanction became important. Mere letters or
certificates emanating from individuals, expressive of opinions
concerning a particular lock, would be out of place in a volume
relating to locks generally; but it is quite within the limits of
the subject, and has indeed become part of the history of locks,
to notice experiments and attempts of a more public character.
We may therefore introduce a few paragraphs of this description,
relating to the career of the American lock in America itself.</p>

<p>The principal bankers at Boston (U.S.) held a meeting to<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
take into consideration measures for testing the security of
bank locks. Consequent on this meeting, Messrs. Day and
Newell deposited five hundred dollars with the cashier of the
State Bank at Boston, to be by him paid to any one who could
pick the parautoptic lock: the trial was to be conducted under
the auspices of the bank. One of the locks was brought to
the bank, and was minutely examined by two machinists on
two afternoons, after which it was secured to an iron chest,
and locked by a committee appointed by the bank. The key
was to remain in the hands of the committee during the trial;
and it was to be used at their discretion, in unlocking and locking
the door, without the knowledge of either of the other parties&mdash;provided
that in so doing no alteration was made in the
combination-parts of the key. Ten days were allowed to the
operators for the examination and the trial; if they succeeded
they were to have five hundred dollars; but if they injured
the lock they agreed to forfeit two hundred, as a purchase
price. At the end of the period the lock remained unopened
and uninjured; and the two deposited sums were accordingly
returned to the respective parties.</p>

<p>Messrs. Page and Bacon, of St. Louis, had a strong-room
lock made by one of the chief locksmiths of that city. To
test its security, the proprietors requested Mr. Hobbs to attempt
to pick it; he did so, and succeeded. Whereupon the
proprietors, having purchased one of the parautoptic locks,
deemed it no more than fair play to subject this lock to a
similar ordeal, an additional zest being given by a reward of
five hundred dollars offered by Day and Newell to the successful
picker. The maker of the former lock accepted the challenge;
he was allowed to examine the new lock piecemeal,
and was then allowed thirty days for his operations in picking.
He failed in the enterprise. Of course, in this, as in all similar
cases, the operator had not access to the true key.</p>

<p>It follows from the nature of this lock, as noticed in a
former chapter, that when the bolt has been shot, if the bits
of the key be re-arranged in any other form, the lock becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
to all intents and purposes a new lock, so far as that key is
concerned, and cannot be unlocked unless the key revert to
its original arrangement. To test this principle, a box with
a parautoptic lock was placed in the room of the American
Institute in 1845; it was locked; the bits of the key (12 in
number) were then re-arranged, and the key was placed in the
hands of any one who chose to try to open the lock&mdash;with
the offer of a reward of five hundred dollars in the event
of the lock being opened. Here, instead of the operator being
called upon to devise new pick-lock implements, he had the
actual key placed in his hands, modified however in such a
way that, though the modifier could restore the original arrangement
(provided he had kept some kind of record), the
operator had numerous chances against his success. The lock
remained unopened notwithstanding this challenge.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to shew presently, that if the number
of tumblers (and consequently the number of bits in the
key) be small&mdash;not exceeding six, for instance&mdash;the possession
of the <i>true</i> key gives any one the power of opening the lock,
provided he has time and patience to go through a few hundred
changes of the bits of the key; for, as some one arrangement
must have been that by which the lock was locked, it must
again occur if the user takes care to make <i>all</i> the arrangements
in turn, and tries the lock after each. Whether this
constitutes picking a lock, each lock-owner will decide for
himself. All that it is at present meant to state is, that <i>without</i>
access to the true key, the parautoptic lock has not hitherto
been opened; and that <i>with</i> the true but altered key the process
of opening is possible, but is slow and tedious.</p>

<p>In 1846 the American Institute appointed a committee to
examine into the merits of the parautoptic lock. On the 18th
of September in that year the Committee made their report,
signed by Professor Renwick and Mr. T. W. Harvey, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Committee of the American Institute, to whom was
referred the examination of <span class="smcap">Newell’s Parautoptic Bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
Lock</span>, report that they have given the subject referred to
them a careful and attentive examination, and have received
full and complete explanations from the inventor. They have
remarked in the lock a number of important advantages, and,
in particular, very great improvements upon the permutation-lock
formerly submitted by him to the American Institute.
Thus, while it retains the advantages of the permutation principle,
combined with the property that the act of locking sets
the slides to the particular arrangement of the bits in the skeleton
key, the parts thus set are completely screened from observation,
from being reached by false instruments, or from
being injured by any violence not sufficient to break the
lock to pieces.</p>

<p>“Having in the course of their inquiries examined the different
existing modes in which locks may be picked, forced, or
opened by false keys, the Committee have come to the conclusion
that the parautoptic lock cannot be opened by any of the
methods now practised, unless by a person in possession of the
key by which it was locked, in the exact form of combination
in which it was used for the purpose, or in the almost impossible
case of the bits being adjusted to the skeleton key by
accident in that very form. As the chances of such accidental
combination range according to the number of movable bits,
from several thousands to several millions to one, the Committee
do not conceive that so small a chance of success would
ever lead to an attempt to profit by it.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, the Committee feel warranted in expressing
the opinion, that unless methods hitherto unknown or
imagined should be contrived for the specific object, the lock
in question may be considered as affording entire and absolute
security.”</p>

<p>The latest form which Messrs. Day and Newell have given
to their challenge, after the experience of the last few years,
is the following:</p>

<p>“First, a Committee of five gentlemen shall be appointed
in the following manner: viz. two by the parties proposing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
operate, and two by ourselves; and by the four thus appointed
a fifth shall be selected.</p>

<p>“In the hands of this Committee shall be placed Two
Thousand Dollars, as a reward to the operator if successful in
picking the lock by fair means.</p>

<p>“We will place upon the inside of an iron door one of our
best bank locks. The operator shall then have the privilege
of taking the lock from the door, and have it in his possession
for examination; it shall then be returned to the Committee
for our inspection, so that we may be assured that it has not
been mutilated or injured. The operator shall then, in the
presence of ourselves and the Committee, place the lock upon
the door in its original position; after which the Committee
shall place upon it their seals, so that it cannot be removed
or altered without their knowledge. The lock being thus
secured to the door, we shall then be allowed to lock it up
ourselves, upon any change of which it is susceptible.</p>

<p>“The time for operation to continue thirty days; and if at
the end of that time he shall consider that he has made any
progress towards picking the said lock, he shall have thirty
days more in which to continue operations.”</p>

<p>The <a href="#Page93">Austrian report</a> concerning the American lock was
given in a former page, to which we may here refer; and then
direct attention to England, and to the discussions which have
lately been carried on respecting the safety of locks.</p>

<p>It is of course natural that each inventor of a new lock
should, while describing the product of his ingenuity, point
out what he conceives to be the imperfections of locks which
have preceded: use has sanctioned the custom not only with
regard to locks, but also in other important matters. Hence
there have been many “lock controversies” in England during
the last seventy years. We have seen how freely and justly the
late Mr. Bramah criticised all the locks that preceded his own;
and he was certainly not the man to shrink from criticism in
his own case. Twenty years ago the Bramah lock was itself
made the subject of criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Ainger, in his lecture on the subject delivered at the
Royal Institution, London, and afterwards in his article “Lock”
in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, thus narrates the circumstances
which led to the adoption of the false notches in the
Bramah lock as a means of security: “At length (after the
original lock had acquired much celebrity,) an advertisement
appeared in the public papers, requesting those who had lost
keys of Bramah’s locks, not, as had hitherto been done, to
break open their doors or drawers, but to apply to the advertiser,
who would undertake to save this destructive process by
picking. And it appeared that an individual of great dexterity
could perform this operation almost with certainty.
The effect of this discovery on the demand for the locks may
easily be imagined; but the effect it had in stimulating ingenuity
to provide a remedy is one of the best illustrations of
the proverb, that necessity is the mother of invention. Within
a few days or weeks, Mr. Russell, who was at that time employed
in Mr. Bramah’s establishment, devised an alteration
which at once, and without any expense, entirely overcame the
difficulty, and converted the lock into one of perfect security.
This contrivance is the most simple and extraordinary that
ever effected so important an object; but before we describe
it, we will endeavour to explain what has been called the <i>tentative</i>
process of lock-picking, and which had been so successfully
applied to Bramah’s locks.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ainger illustrates the subject by an engraving&mdash;not of
an actual lock, but of an hypothetical arrangement of bolts
and notches; and he then makes his reasoning apply to the
actual process adopted by the picker of the real lock. “A
tendency to revolve was given with some force to the barrel;
then, by means of a pair of small forceps, the tumblers (sliders)
were tried, and it was ascertained which one was most detained
by the pressure against the locking-plate. That which
offered most resistance was gradually depressed till its notch
was felt to hang itself upon the locking-plate; and so on till the
whole were depressed in succession, exactly as they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
have been depressed simultaneously by the key.” Mr. Ainger
then describes the contrivance which, in his judgment, seemed
to render any further attempts to pick the Bramah lock hopeless.
This consisted in cutting false notches in the sliders; so
as to render it impossible for the picker to tell when he has
brought a notch to the plane of the locking-plate, whether it
is a true notch, or one of shallower depth, unfitted to admit
the movement of the plate.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting statement, for it shews that the
mechanical or tentative method of opening was known in
England long ago, although very little attention has been since
paid to it. In a complex Bramah lock, and in locks on the combination
principle, the difficulty of picking is almost insuperable,
so long as what may be termed the arithmetical method
is adopted. It is perfectly true, as has been so often stated,
that the varied combinations in the arrangement of the slides
amount to millions and even billions, when the slides are in
any degree numerous; and if a person attempt to pick the
lock by ringing the changes on all these combinations, it
would very likely require the lives of a dozen Methuselahs to
bring the enterprise to an end. But by the mechanical method,
sketched so clearly by Mr. Ainger, the exploit puts on a
different aspect. The experimenter passes through the keyhole
an instrument so arranged as to give a <i>tendency</i> in the
bolt to withdraw in the wished-for direction; and a pressure
produced in the slides by this tendency gives information concerning
the state of the slides; and then comes the tentative
process on the slides themselves. Mr. Ainger was quite right
in describing the false notches as an admirable addition to the
safety of the Bramah lock; but he was not correct in stating
that these notches rendered any further attempts on the lock
hopeless. The false notches are not so deep as the true; they
will permit the barrel to turn partially but not wholly round.
But even supposing that the false notch had been hit upon in
nearly every slide instead of the true, and that the barrel had
been partially turned to the extent which these notches permitted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
there would then be a binding action at the false
notches different from that in the true, and this would guide
the operator in his search for the true notches. It would not
add a new principle different from the one before in action,
but it would add to the time during which the search would
have to be carried on.</p>

<p>We make these remarks in connection with Mr. Ainger’s
article, which was probably written twenty years ago. We
now come to the year 1850.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers, when
Mr. Chubb’s paper was read, many challenges and counter-challenges
were made, as to the possibility of picking certain
locks. Mr. Chubb described, among others, a lock on the
patent of Mr. Davies, which, ingenious though it be, he considers
not safe. Captain D. O’Brien differed from Mr. Chubb
in this matter; he had had occasion to open from ten to
twenty of Davies’s cabinet-locks daily, during a period of two
years, and he never once observed the locks to be out of
order; in fact, they always appeared to afford great security.
Mr. Chubb thereupon rejoined, that he was prepared to produce
a workman who would pick any number of Davies’
cabinet-locks, of different combinations, which he had never
seen before, taking only half an hour for each lock.</p>

<p>As another instance, Captain O’Brien stated that, in his
capacity as Inspector of Government Prisons, his attention had
been much directed to the subject of secure locks; and he
produced, among others, specimens of those in use at the
Pentonville Prison; though not of first-rate workmanship, he
characterised them as being safe, strong, and cheap. They
were on Thomas’s principle. The locks had been in use
eight years, during which period not one had required to be
replaced; and any trifling derangements had been made good
whilst the prisoners were at exercise. Mr. Chubb, after making
his offer concerning Davies’s lock, stated that “he was
willing to make the same offer with respect to the locks from
the Pentonville Prison; and he might state that, in point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
security, he considered them absolutely worthless;” in proof of
which he exhibited one of them, and a common burglar’s tool,
by which the lock could be opened with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>In respect to Bramah’s lock, there was no particular challenge
associated with the proceedings of the evening; but
incidental observations were made as to the degree of security
pertaining to it. Mr. Farey, after passing a high eulogium on
the ingenuity of the principle and the beauty of the workmanship,
considered it nevertheless objectionable that the sliders
should be so completely exposed to view. He then proceeded
to make the following observations: “It had been suggested,
that a universal false key for Bramah’s locks might be made,
with the bottoms of its several notches formed by as many
small steel sliders, extending beyond the handle of the key, so
as to receive pressure from the fingers, for moving each one
of the sliders within the lock, with a sliding motion in its
own groove, independently of the other. During such sliding
motion, a gentle force could be exerted, tending to turn the
barrel round. Under such circumstances, supposing that the
motion of the barrel was prevented by any one slider only;
that one, having to resist all the turning force, would be felt
to slide more stiffly endways in its groove, and therefore it
could be felt when its unlocking notch arrived opposite the
steel plate, and left some other slider to begin to resist the
turning force. Such a circumstance (continues Mr. Farey) presumes
a palpable inaccuracy in the radiating correspondence
between the notches in the steel plate and the grooves for the
sliders in the barrel, which could not happen with Bramah’s
workmanship.”<a id="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He further remarked: “Unfortunately, if a
Bramah’s key fell into dishonest hands, even for a short time,
an impression could be easily taken, and a false key as easily
made. A turkey-quill, notched into the form of a key, had
sufficed to open a Bramah’s lock; and an efficient false key
could be formed out of a pocket pencil-case. Such facility
of fabrication was an invitation to dishonesty; and as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
abortive attempt left no trace, the impunity was an encouragement
to repeat the attempt until success is attained.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>With respect to Chubb’s locks, a discussion arose out of
a statement made by Mr. Hodge. Mr. Chubb had himself
stated it to be a general opinion that a skilful workman,
furnished with impressions taken from the true key, in wax
or soap, could make a false key to open any lock; and he
considered that, in common locks, with the most elaborate
wards, but with only one tumbler, as also in Bramah’s
locks, there was much truth in the notion. In respect to
his own lock, however, with six double-acting tumblers, “a
false key made ever so carefully from impressions would
not be likely to open the lock, for want of exactitude in
the lengths of the several steps; and if the key could not be
made exact from the impressions, there would be no chance
of rectifying it by trial in the lock, on account of the total
uncertainty as to which part required alteration.” Mr. Hodge
stated that, in America, he had repeatedly seen impressions
taken of locks having twelve or fourteen tumblers, in consequence
of the bellies of the tumblers, when at rest, coinciding
with the form of the key (see <a href="#Page63">page 63</a>). He also suggested a
method of taking an impression of the bellies of the tumblers;
but Mr. Chubb, Mr. Farey, Mr. Stephenson, and Mr. Whitworth,
all expressed a disbelief that a Chubb’s lock could be opened
by the means indicated by Mr. Hodge. Mr. Hodge admitted
that he was not aware of any lock actually made by Messrs.
Chubb having been picked in America; but that the locks to
which he had adverted were such exact imitations, that he had
no doubt of the Chubb lock yielding to similar treatment. He
further stated that there were persons in New York who would
undertake to pick a real Chubb lock.</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER IX.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE LOCK CONTROVERSY: DURING AND SINCE THE TIME OF THE
GREAT EXHIBITION.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">We next come to the remarkable year 1851, which produced
so many unexpected results in connection with the industrial
display in Hyde Park, and conferred a lasting benefit on the
useful arts and manufactures of the United Kingdom, by
bringing their products into contrast and competition with
those of other nations. It was to be expected that such a trial
as this would afford evidences of national failure as well as of
success; but probably no one suspected before the trial, that
English locks, so celebrated over the greater part of the world
for skilful mechanical design, beauty of workmanship, and
perfect inviolability, would readily yield to a well-arranged
system of lock-picking. Such, however, was the case; and
we are bound to admit that Mr. Hobbs, the author of this
system, is a mechanician of great skill, and with a profound
knowledge of the art of the locksmith.</p>

<p>The first step in the celebrated <i>lock controversy</i> of 1851
was taken by Mr. Hobbs himself, who declared to a party of
scientific men in the Crystal Palace, that all the locks made
in this country up to that date admitted of being very easily
picked; and in order to explain to these gentlemen the principle
upon which this was to be done, Mr. Hobbs picked one
of Chubb’s patent detector-locks in their presence in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>The fairness of this experiment having been called in question
by certain persons who were not present at the time when it
was made, Mr. Hobbs, on July 21st, 1851, wrote a letter from
the American department of the Great Exhibition, to Messrs.
Chubb, simply announcing that an attempt would be made,
on the next following day, to pick a lock manufactured by<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
them, and which was at that time on the door of a strong room
in a house named by Mr. Hobbs. Messrs. Chubb were invited
to be present at the operation; but no member of the
firm attended. What occurred on the day specified may best
be given in the words of a letter written by those who witnessed
the operation.</p>

<p class="right padr2 blankbefore75 fsize90">“London, July 22, 1851.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">“We the undersigned hereby certify, that we attended,
with the permission of Mr. Bell, of No. 34 Great George-street,
Westminster, an invitation sent to us by A. C. Hobbs, of
the City of New York, to witness an attempt to open a lock
throwing three bolts and having six tumblers, affixed to the
iron door of a strong-room or vault, built for the depository of
valuable papers, and formerly occupied by the agents of the
South-Eastern Railway; that we severally witnessed the operation,
which Mr. Hobbs commenced at 35 minutes past 11
o’clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and opened the lock within 25 minutes. Mr.
Hobbs having been requested to lock it again with his instruments,
accomplished it in the short space of 7 minutes, without
the slightest injury to the lock or door. We minutely
examined the lock and door (having previously had the assurance
of Mr. Bell that the keys had never been accessible to
Mr. Hobbs, he having had permission to examine the key-hole
only). We found a plate at the back of the door with the
following inscription: ‘Chubb’s New Patent (No. 261,461),

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote7"></a><a href="#FNanchor7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Late Secretary to the Board of Trade.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p class="noindent">Several of these names are well and publicly known in
England and the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span></p>

<p>This event gave rise to much newspaper controversy; and
attempts were made to shew that, as this was not a <i>test</i> lock,
prepared expressly for challenge, the picking proved nothing
as regards the finest of the manufacturers’ locks. Two circumstances,
however, have to be noticed&mdash;that the lock was of sufficient
commercial importance to be placed on a door enclosing
valuable papers, and that the makers had an opportunity to
attend and witness, and comment on the trial, if they so chose.
We may here remark, that one of the ingenious contrivances of
the Chubb lock, the <i>detector</i>, excited some doubt no less than
fifteen years ago, as will be seen from the following. The
writer of the article “Lock” in Hebert’s <i>Engineers’ and Mechanics’
Encyclopædia</i>, while speaking with much commendation
of Chubb’s locks, points out a curious feature, which
seems to him to render somewhat doubtful the surety of the
<i>detector</i> apparatus. “In Barron’s and Bramah’s locks,” he
observes, “the picker has no means of knowing whether the
tumblers are lifted too high or not; but in Chubb’s he has
only to put the detector <i>hors de combat</i> in the first instance,
by a correct thrust from the outside of the door (which might
be accurately measured), so as to <i>fix</i> it fast in its place; the
detector then becomes a stopper to the undue ascent of the
tumblers, and the extent of their range is thereby correctly
ascertained. Thus, it appears to us, the <i>detector</i> might be
converted into a <i>director</i> of the means for opening the
lock.”</p>

<p>Much will depend on the view which is taken of the circumstance
just noted. The object of the detector is, not to
prevent the lock from being picked, but to shew that an
attempt has been made to pick it; or, at least, to attain a
given purpose by an indirect instead of a direct method. But
if there be really any truth in the surmise, that the detector
actually guides a skilful hand in determining how high the
tumblers should be raised, the supposed advantage will be
purchased at rather a dear rate. As we are here, however,
speaking of facts and not of mere opinions, it is proper to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
that the lock opened by Mr. Hobbs had the detector apparatus,
but that it was not disturbed by him in picking the lock.</p>

<p>But instead of reiterating opinions, we will state the method
by which most of the tumbler-locks made in England, up to
the date of the Great Exhibition, can be opened or picked.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the principle on which the picking of locks
is said to depend, namely, that “whenever the parts of a lock
which come in contact with the key are affected by any pressure
applied to the bolt, or to that portion of the lock by which
the bolt is withdrawn, in such a manner as to indicate the
points of resistance to the withdrawal of the bolt, such a lock
can be picked,” the first step is to produce the requisite pressure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig49">
<img src="images/illo118.png" alt="Pipe key" />
<p class="caption">fig. 49.</p>
</div>

<p>If the end of the bolt were exposed, this pressure might be
applied by some force tending to shoot back the bolt; but as
the bolt, whenever it is shot, is buried in the jamb of the door,
or otherwise concealed from view, the pressure can in general
only be applied through the key-hole. In order, therefore, to
apply this pressure, the operator provides himself with an instrument
capable of reaching the talon of the bolt, which in
the case of the Chubb lock was a pipe-key of the form shewn
at <i>a b</i>, <a href="#Fig49">fig. 49</a>, furnished at the pipe-end with that portion of
the bit of the key <i>b c</i> which moves the bolt (see <a href="#Fig32">fig. 32</a>, page
57, where the step which acts on the bolt is called the terminal
step). The other end of the pipe-key is made square, as at <i>a</i>,
for the purpose of receiving the square eye <i>e</i> of the lever <i>e f</i>,
<a href="#Fig50">fig. 50</a>, to the further end of which <i>f</i> a weight <i>w</i> is attached by
means of a string <i>s</i>. Now it is evident that if this pipe be
introduced into the lock as far as it will go, and be turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
round as in the act of unlocking, and the lever and weight be
attached to the end <i>a</i>, the bit <i>b c</i> of the pipe-key will maintain
a permanent pressure on the bolt, which, if the weight be
sufficient, will throw back the bolt as
soon as the tumblers are raised to
the proper height to allow the stump
to pass.</p>

<div class="hh">

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig50">

</div>

<div class="figleft nomargin up5px">
<img src="images/illo119b.png" alt="Bottom" />
</div>

</div><!--scr-->

<p>The next step in the operation is
to raise the tumblers to the proper
height. For this purpose a second
pipe <i>m n</i> is made to slide upon the
first with an easy motion, and by
means of the cross handle <i>h h</i> can
be turned round or slid backwards
and forwards on the tube <i>a b</i>. This
tube <i>m n</i> is also furnished with a
single projecting bit or step <i>n o</i>, corresponding with one of the
six steps of the key, <a href="#Fig32">fig. 32</a>, and made of the proper length for
entering the key-hole.</p>

<p>Now for the operation of opening a tumbler-lock with this
simple apparatus. Referring to <a href="#Fig31">fig. 31</a>, page 56, it will be
evident that if the pipe <i>a b</i>, <a href="#Fig49">fig. 49</a>, be passed over the pin of
the lock and turned round towards the left, and the weight be
attached, there will be a tendency in the bolt to shoot back,
which tendency will bring the stump <i>s</i>, <a href="#Fig31">fig. 31</a>, up against the
inner angle or shoulder of one or other of the tumblers, whichever
happens to project, however slightly; or, as Mr. Hobbs
expresses it, “one or more of the tumblers will bind.” By
moving forward the pipe <i>m n</i> and turning round the bit <i>n o</i> in
the lock, it is easy to ascertain, by delicate touch, which of
the tumblers it is that binds. It may be found that all are
free to move except one or two against which the stump is
pressing with the force of the weight <i>w</i>, <a href="#Fig50">fig. 50</a>. The bit <i>n o</i>
is therefore brought gently under the bellies of the tumblers
which bind, and they are moved slightly upwards until they
cease to bind. As soon as they are set free another tumbler<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
will bind; that is, the bolt will move through a small space, so
as to bring the stump into contact with that particular tumbler
which now projects; this in its turn is relieved, another tumbler
binds and is relieved, and so on until the tumblers are,
one by one, raised to the proper height for the stump to pass.
When the last binding tumbler is raised to the proper height,
the weight <i>w</i> being no longer resisted, shoots the bolt back,
and the work is done.</p>

<p>Now it must be evident that in this operation the detector
apparatus need not come into operation. But if, as has been
proposed, a detector-spring be added to each tumbler, it may
be converted into a friend or a foe according to the use that is
made of it. If the tumblers are lifted <i>too high</i>, they will be
detained or detected in that position, and the operator will
have to release them by turning the bit round in the opposite
direction before he can begin his work again. The same
force, however, which detains the tumblers when they are
lifted too high will obviously detain them when they are
lifted only just high enough, and thus the detector-springs
would really be of great assistance to the operator in picking
such a tumbler-lock.</p>

<p>The apparatus which we have described for picking the
tumbler-lock must be varied to suit the form of key employed
in opening the lock; but it is not difficult, in the case of most
locks, to ascertain this form through the key-hole, without
examining the key itself.</p>

<p>It is but fair to state in this place, that since the above
method of picking tumbler-locks was made known,<a id="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Mr. Chubb<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
has added a series of teeth and notches to the stump and tumblers;
the effect of which would evidently prevent the application
of the above method of picking, because any permanent
pressure applied to the bolt would send a tooth of the stump
into a notch of the tumbler, and prevent all further motion.
But recurring to the principle, that whenever the parts of a
lock which come in contact with the key indicate the points of
resistance when any pressure (<i>whether permanent or temporary</i>)
is applied in attempting to withdraw the bolt, that lock can be
picked, it follows, if this principle be admitted, that although
the notches prevent the application of the form of instrument
described, yet there is sufficient indication afforded by the
pressure to enable a skilful operator, with proper instruments,
to form a false key, as was done in the case of the lock referred
to at <a href="#Page104">page 104</a>. We now proceed to the second stage in the
lock controversy of 1851.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote8"></a><a href="#FNanchor8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
We believe the method was first made publicly known at a special
general meeting of the members of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers,
held at the rooms of the Society of Arts, London, on the 30th June, 1851,
when a paper was read by Mr. Paul R. Hodge “On the progress of improvements
in locks in the United States of America.” A report of this
paper, together with the discussion thereon, was published by Waterlow
and Sons, London Wall, 1851. Plate 34 (figs. 9 and 10) of this report
contains representations of the lock-picking apparatus, from which we have
copied our figures.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Soon after the picking of the Chubb lock in Great George-street,
and consequent on the excitement and discussion to
which that operation led, a committee, consisting of Mr. G.
Rennie, Professor Cowper,<a id="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and Dr. Black, agreed to superintend
the arrangements for a more severe testing of Mr.
Hobbs’s power to open locks. There had been for many years
exhibited in the window of Messrs. Bramah’s shop, in Piccadilly,
a padlock of great complexity and beauty; to which an
announcement was affixed, that a reward of two hundred
guineas would be given to any person who should succeed in
picking that lock. This challenge was accepted by Mr. Hobbs;
and the committee managed all the arrangements, as arbitrators
between Mr. Hobbs on the one side and Messrs. Bramah
on the other. The lock was removed to an upper room in
Messrs. Bramah’s establishment; where it was placed between
two boards, and so fixed and sealed, that no access could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
obtained to any part of it except through the key-hole. The
room was to be given up to Mr. Hobbs; he was not to be interrupted
by the presence or entrance of any other persons; and
he was allowed a period of thirty days for opening the lock.
If the lock was not picked at the expiration of that period, Mr.
Hobbs was to be considered as having failed in his attempt.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote9"></a><a href="#FNanchor9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
In mentioning the name of the late Professor Edward Cowper, we
cannot refrain from deploring the loss which mechanical science has suffered
by his too-early death. The application of mechanical principles to manufactures
was treated by him in his lectures and illustrations with a felicity
which has been rarely equalled.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>There was much negotiation and correspondence before
and during Mr. Hobbs’s operation on this lock. On July 2,
he, with a view to this enterprise, applied for permission to
take wax impressions of the key-hole. This permission being
given, and the parties having met to discuss the necessary arrangements,
an agreement was signed on the 19th, reciting the
terms of the challenge, and providing that thirty days should be
allowed to Mr. Hobbs to effect his enterprise; that the lock
should be secured in a certain specified way; and that the key
should remain in the possession of Messrs. Bramah, who were to
retain the right of using it in the lock when Mr. Hobbs was not
at work. Messrs. Bramah subsequently relinquished this last-mentioned
privilege, in order that the trial might be perfectly
fair; and it was agreed that the key should be sealed up
during the whole period, beyond the reach either of Mr.
Hobbs or Messrs. Bramah; and that the key-hole should be
secured by an iron band, sealed, when Mr. Hobbs was not at
work. These and other conditions were embodied in the
agreement noticed in the last paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs commenced his labours on July 24th. After a
few visits to the lock, Messrs. Bramah wished to have the privilege
of inspecting it, or else that such an inspection should be
made by the arbitrators; and, during a correspondence which
arose out of this request, the operations were suspended. Mr.
Hobbs resumed his work on August 16. On the 23d, Messrs.
Bramah drew the attention of the arbitrators to the challenge,
that the reward of two hundred guineas was offered to the artist
who should make an instrument that would pick or open the
lock; that he was to be paid the money on the production of
the instrument; and that, unless some person were present, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
was impossible that any one could know that the lock had
been opened by the instrument which might be produced.
This letter was not allowed by the arbitrators to affect the
arrangements made. We may now consistently give the
“Report of the Arbitrators.”</p>

<p>“Whereas for many years past a padlock has been exhibited
in the window of Messrs. Bramah’s shop, in Piccadilly,
to which was appended a label with these words: ‘The artist
who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock
shall receive two hundred guineas the moment it is produced;’
and Mr. Hobbs, of America, having obtained permission of
Messrs. Bramah to make trial of his skill in opening the said
lock, Messrs. Bramah and Mr. Hobbs severally agreed that
George Rennie, Esq., F.R.S., of London; and Professor Cowper,
of King’s College, London; and Dr. Black, of Kentucky;
should act as arbitrators between the said parties.</p>

<p>“That the trial should be conducted according to the rules
laid down by the arbitrators, and the reward of two hundred
guineas be decided by them; in fine, that they should see fair
play between the parties.</p>

<p>“On July 23 it was agreed that the lock should be enclosed
in a block of wood, and screwed to a door, and the
screws sealed, the key-hole and the hasp only being accessible
to Mr. Hobbs; and, when he was not operating, the key-hole
was to be covered with a band of iron and sealed by Mr.
Hobbs, that no other person should have access to the key-hole.
The key was also sealed up, and was not to be used
until Mr. Hobbs had finished his operations. If Mr. Hobbs
succeeded in picking or opening the lock, the key was to be
tried; and if it locked and unlocked the padlock, it should be
considered as a proof that Mr. Hobbs had not injured the
lock, but had fairly picked or opened it, and was entitled to
the two hundred guineas.</p>

<p>“On the same day, July 23, Messrs. Bramah gave notice
to Mr. Hobbs that the lock was ready for his operations.</p>

<p>“On July 24 Mr. Hobbs commenced his operations; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
on August 23 Mr. Hobbs exhibited the <i>lock opened</i> to Dr.
Black and Professor Cowper (Mr. Rennie being out of town).
Dr. Black and Mr. Cowper then called in Mr. Edward Bramah
and Mr. Bazalgette, and shewed them the lock opened; they
[the last-named two gentlemen are of course meant] then withdrew,
and Mr. Hobbs locked and unlocked the padlock in presence
of Dr. Black and Mr. Cowper.</p>

<p>“Between July 24 and Aug. 23 Mr. Hobbs’s operations
were for a time suspended; so that the number of days occupied
by Mr. Hobbs was sixteen, and the number of hours he
was actually in the room with the lock was fifty-one.</p>

<p>“On Friday, Aug. 29, Mr. Hobbs again locked and unlocked
the padlock in presence of Mr. G. Rennie, Professor
Cowper, Dr. Black, Mr. Edward Bramah, Mr. Bazalgette, and
Mr. Abrahart.</p>

<p>“On Saturday, Aug. 30, the key was tried, and the padlock
was locked and unlocked with the key, by Professor
Cowper, Mr. Rennie, and Mr. Gilbertson; thus proving that
Mr. Hobbs had fairly picked the lock without injuring it.
Mr. Hobbs then formally produced the instruments with which
he had opened the lock.</p>

<p>“We are, therefore, unanimously of opinion, that Messrs.
Bramah have given Mr. Hobbs a fair opportunity of trying
his skill, and that Mr. Hobbs has fairly picked or opened the
lock; and we award that Messrs. Bramah and Co. do now pay
to Mr. Hobbs the two hundred guineas.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">It may be here stated, in reference to the space of time
during which the operations were being conducted, that the
actual opening of the lock occurred much earlier, so far as
concerned the principle involved, though not in a way to meet
the terms of the challenge. On his fifth visit, Mr. Hobbs succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
in adjusting the slides and moving the barrel, preparatory
to withdrawing the bolt; but the instrument with which
the barrel was to be turned round, being too slight, slipped,
and defeated the operation. Mr. Hobbs had then to readjust
the barrel, and to make a new instrument to aid him; this
new instrument, when completed, enabled him to open the
lock in the space of an hour or two.</p>

<p>On the same day Messrs. Bramah addressed a letter to the
arbitrators, stating the reasons which induced them to think
that, though Mr. Hobbs had succeeded in opening the lock,
the manner of doing so did not come within the meaning of
the challenge originally made by them. The arbitrators,
however, were unanimous in their award, and Messrs. Bramah
bowed to it.</p>

<p>In an article written in one of the daily newspapers immediately
after the opening of the lock, the following notice
was given of the lock and its production: “We were surprised
to find that the lock which has made so much noise in the
world is a padlock of but 4 inches in width, the body of it 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
inches thick, and its thickness over the boss 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches. Upon
opening the outer case of the lock, the actual barrel enclosing
the mechanism was found to be 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches in length and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
inches in diameter. The small space in which the works were
confined, and its snug, compact appearance was matter of astonishment
to all present. The lock and key were made forty
years since by the present head of the eminent firm of Messrs.
Maudslay and Co., Mr. Maudslay being at that time a workman
in the employ of Mr. Bramah.”</p>

<p>We may here remark, as indeed has been remarked in
former pages, that the Bramah lock is, and will probably continue
to be, deservedly celebrated for the amount of mechanism
contained in a small space, as adverted to in the last paragraph.
The cylindrical form is well calculated for this concentration
of power within narrow limits; and the smallness of
the key is a great merit.</p>

<p>The objections made by Messrs. Bramah to the award of<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
the committee were embodied in the following letter to Mr.
Rennie, dated 9th September:</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;We beg to acknowledge your letter of yesterday’s
date, and will not trouble you to attend here to-morrow,
but beg to hand you the 210<i>l.</i> awarded by the arbitrators to
Mr. Hobbs. We need scarcely repeat that the decision at
which the arbitrators have arrived has surprised us much;
and we owe it to ourselves and the public to protest against
it. We do so for the following reasons:</p>

<p>“1. Because the arbitrators, having been appointed to see
fair-play, and that the lock was fairly operated upon, did not,
although repeatedly requested in writing to do so, once inspect
or allow any one to witness Mr. Hobbs’s operations during the
sixteen days he had the sole custody of the lock and was engaged
in the work.</p>

<p>“2. Because the arbitrators did not once exercise their right
of using the key, although repeatedly requested in writing to
do so, till after Mr. Hobbs had completed his operations; and
then, instead of applying at once to prove that no damage had
been done to the lock, allowed him twenty-four hours to repair
any that might have occurred.</p>

<p>“3. Because the lock being opened by means of a fixed apparatus
screwed to the wood-work in which the lock was enclosed
for the purpose of experiment (which it is obvious could
not have been applied to an iron door without discovery), and
the addition of three or four other instruments, the spirit of
the challenge has evidently not been complied with.</p>

<p>“4. Because from the course adopted an opportunity of some
good scientific results has been taken from us; as neither arbitrators
nor any one else saw the whole or even the most important
instruments, by which it is said the lock was picked,
actually applied in operation, either before or after the lock
was presented open to the arbitrators.</p>

<p>“5. Because during the progress of Mr. Hobbs’s operations,
and several days before their completion, we called the attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
of the arbitrators to what we considered the interpretation
of the challenge, begging at the same time that they would
apply the key and appoint some one to be present during the
residue of the experiment; feeling that whatever might be the
result in a scientific point of view, the reward could not be
awarded.</p>

<p>“We would add, that we think that several points which
appear in your minutes should not have been mentioned in
your award; more especially that Mr. Hobbs on the 2d of
June took a wax-impression of the lock, and had made, as far
as he could, instruments therefrom between that date and the
commencement of his operations.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr20">“We are, dear sir,</span><br />
<span class="padr8">“Your obedient servants,</span><br />
<span class="padr2">“<span class="smcap">Bramah and Co.</span>”</span></p>

</div><!--letter-->

<p>In order that the opinions of Messrs. Bramah and others
may be given with as much fairness as possible, on a matter
which they could not feel but otherwise than important to them,
we may state, that among the letters to which the picking of
the Bramah lock gave rise in the public journals, was the following
addressed to the <i>Observer</i> newspaper on 10th October:</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;This controversy having excited an unusual degree
of public attention for some time past, perhaps you will be
good enough to allow us to state in your journal, that the lock
on which Mr. Hobbs operated had not been taken to pieces for
many years, and it was only on examining it (after the award
of the committee) that we discovered the startling fact, that in
no less than three particulars it is inferior to those we have
made for years past. The lock had remained so long in its
resting-place in our window that the proposal of Mr. Hobbs
somewhat surprised us. After his appearance, however, no
alteration could of course be made without our incurring the
risk of being charged with preparing a test-lock for the occasion;
we were therefore bound in honour to let the lock remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
as Mr. Hobbs found it when he accepted the challenge.
No one inspected his operations during the sixteen days he
had the sole custody of the lock and was engaged at the work.
We are therefore compelled to advertise another 200 guineas,
in order that we may see the lock operated upon and opened,
if it be possible; and thus gain such information as would
enable us to use means that would defy even the acknowledged
skill of our American friends. We believe the Bramah
lock to be impregnable; and we cannot open it ourselves,
with the knowledge Mr. Hobbs has given us. We
have fitted up the same lock with such improvements as we
now use, and some trifling change suggested by the recent
trial, and restored it with its challenge to our window. We
have not done this in a vain, boasting spirit; on the contrary,
we feel it rather hard that, from the way in which the former
trial was conducted, we are driven to adopt this course. Had
any one inspected Mr. Hobbs’s operations during that trial, it
would not have been necessary.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr20">“We are, sir, &amp;c.,</span><br />
<span class="padr2">“<span class="smcap">Bramah and Co.</span>”</span></p>

</div><!--letter-->

<p>Messrs. Bramah are well entitled to offer any explanation
concerning the relative perfection of the lock in question, and
of one that they could now produce with certain improvements
in some parts of the working mechanism; but if these improvements
do not involve any new invention, patented or otherwise,&mdash;that
is, if the lock be really a carrying out of the contrivances
already made public,&mdash;it is difficult to see why it should
not yield to the same treatment as the other. It is true that,
shortly after the decision of the arbitrators, Messrs. Bramah
exhibited a new lock in their window, and repeated their challenge
in the same terms as before, with the single addition,
that applications were to be made in writing only. We have
reason to know that an application was made, and that the
consequence was the withdrawal of the challenge. In respect
to the actual contest, however, the character and position of<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
the arbitrators ought surely to hold Mr. Hobbs justified in his
proceedings. They were not all Americans (supposing nationality
to give a bias in the matter); two were Englishmen,
both of distinguished rank in respect to mechanical knowledge;
and as Mr. Hobbs was as much bound by their decision
as Messrs. Bramah, he was entitled to claim any advantage
resulting from a favourable decision.</p>

<p>The following is a description, so far as can be given in
words, of the mode in which Mr. Hobbs operated on the Bramah
lock. The first point to be attained was to free the sliders
from the pressure of the spiral spring; the spring was very
powerful, pressing with a force of between 30 and 40 lbs.; and
until this was counteracted, the sliders could not be readily
moved in their grooves. A thin steel rod, drilled at one end,
and having two long projecting teeth, was introduced into the
key-hole and pressed against the circular disc between the
heads of the sliders; the disc and spring were pressed as far
as they would go. In order to retain them in this position,
a curved stanchion was screwed into the side of the boards
surrounding the lock, and the end brought to press upon the
steel rod, a thumb-screw passing through the drilled portion of
the instrument and keeping it in its place. The sliders being
thus freed from the action of the spring, operations commenced
for ascertaining their proper relative positions. A plain steel
needle, with a moderately fine point, was used for pushing in
the sliders; while another with a small hook at the end, something
like a crochet-needle, was used for drawing them back
when pushed too far. By gently feeling along the edge of the
slider, the notch was found and adjusted, and its exact position
was then accurately measured by means of a thin and narrow
plate of brass, the measurements being recorded on the brass
for future reference. The operator was thus enabled, by this
record, to commence each morning’s work at the point where
he left off on the previous day. The lock having eighteen
sliders, the process of finding the exact position of the notch
in each was necessarily slow. Mr. Hobbs employed a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
bent instrument to perform the part of the small lever or bit
of the key; with this he kept constantly pressing on the cylinder
which moved the bolt. He thus knew that if ever he got the
slide-notches into the right place, the cylinder would rotate and
the lock open. He could feel the varying resistance to which
the sliders were subjected by this tendency of the cylinder to
rotate; and he adjusted them one by one until the notch came
opposite the steel plate. The false notches added, of course,
much to his difficulty; for when he had <i>partially</i> rotated the
cylinder by means of the false notches, he had to begin again
to find out the true ones.</p>

<p>This description accords pretty nearly with that given in a
former page; but we reproduce it here to shew not merely
what <i>might</i> be the process adopted, but what really <i>has been</i>
done. One circumstance ought at least to be noted in these
transactions&mdash;there is no mystery; the method adopted is the
result of a process of reasoning candidly and openly explained.</p>

<p>In justice to Messrs. Bramah we thought it our duty to
give them an opportunity of stating what improvements they
had made in their locks since the date of the Great Exhibition;
and accordingly, on the 28th April, 1853, our publisher addressed
to Messrs. Bramah a note, stating that a <i>Rudimentary
Treatise on the Construction of Locks</i> was being prepared, and
inviting them to contribute thereto. The following is a copy
of their reply:</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="right padr2 fsize90">“124 Piccadilly, May 2d, 1853.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Pressure of business has prevented our sending an
earlier reply to your favour of the 28th ult.</p>

<p>“The lock on which Mr. Hobbs operated during the Great
Exhibition had been made nearly forty years, and when taken
to pieces the sliders were found to be in iron, instead of steel;
and the key-hole of the lock being three times larger than it
ought to have been, enabled the operator to fix down the spring
of the lock, and yet leave himself ample space to turn and bend
the sliders (being in iron) at pleasure. The barrel of the lock
in which the sliders act, instead of being whole length from<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
front to back of padlock, was not quite half its proper length;
a serious oversight in the workman who put the lock together,
as the barrel being short, the sliders were necessarily so, which
diminished the number of notches in the sliders full one-half,
and to that extent diminished the security of the lock, and increased
the facility of the operator.</p>

<p>“We send for your inspection a box of guards, which will
shew you the barrel and sliders of our Bramah lock. You
will observe several notches in each slider, only one of which
will turn on the locking-plate, the others being what are termed
false, or security ones. These notches being cut only the exact
width of the locking-plate, require the most perfect accuracy
to carry each down to its proper distance. In the lock on
which Mr. Hobbs operated, in addition to the sliders being so
short, and only half the number of security-notches in each,
the notch which passed round the locking-plate was found to
be cut twice the width it ought to have been. The whole of
these defects have been corrected since the Exhibition.</p>

</div><!--letter-->

<p>In the Jury Report of the Great Exhibition, Class XXII.,
are the following remarks: “On the comparative security
afforded by the various locks which have come before the
jury, they are not prepared to offer an opinion. They would
merely express a doubt whether the circumstance that a lock
has been picked under conditions which ordinarily could
scarcely ever, if at all be obtained, can be assumed as a test
of its insecurity.” [page 500]. The conditions here alluded to
probably refer to the free access which Messrs. Bramah allowed
Mr. Hobbs to have to their lock during a period of thirty days,
and we are hence led to infer that the burglar is denied any
such facilities. On this point we would refer to the opinion
of a high authority. In a paper “on the History and Construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
of Latches and Locks,” by Mr. Chubb, read before the
Society of Arts, 22d January, 1851, the following graphic
passage occurs:</p>

<p>“In order to shew the absolute necessity of secure locks
and safe depositories for property, especially in banking establishments,
it may not be out of place to trace the systematic
care and great sagacity with which the large burglaries are
planned. You will bear in mind that an unsuccessful attempt
is seldom made where the booty is of any magnitude. The
first-rate ‘cracksmen’ always know beforehand where to go,
when to go, and what they are going for. When a ‘plant,’
as it is termed, is made upon a house or a bank, precise information
is gained, if possible, as to the depository of the valuables;
and if it is found that the safeguards are too strong in
themselves, and that the locks are invulnerable, the affair is
quietly dropped. But if otherwise, then no expenditure of
time or misapplied ingenuity is spared to gain the desired
end. The house is constantly watched, the habits of its inmates
are observed, their ordinary times of going out and
coming in are noted; the confidential servants are bribed or
cajoled, and induced to leave the premises when their employers
are absent, so that impressions may be taken from
the locks, and false keys made. When all the keys required
are made, one or two men who have not been previously initiated
are generally called in, and receive their instructions to
be ready at a certain hour on the following day to enter the
house. A plan of the premises is put into their hands, they
are cautioned to step over a certain creaking stair or plank,
and the keys of the different doors are given them. The day
or evening is chosen when it is known that the inmates will
be from home&mdash;the servant, taking advantage of their absence,
fulfils a long-standing engagement with his new and liberal
friends&mdash;a signal is given&mdash;the two confederates enter&mdash;the
so-called safe is swept of its contents, all the doors are carefully
re-locked, and not until the bank is opened for business
next morning is the robbery discovered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span></p>

<p>In an article in <i>Frazer’s Magazine</i> for November 1852 the
following observations were made on the Exhibition Jury Report
on Locks: “This jury seems to have consisted of the only
persons in England who did not hear of the famous ‘lock controversy’
of last year; for one can hardly imagine that, if they
had heard of a matter of so much consequence to the subject
they were appointed to investigate, they would have altogether
abstained from saying any thing about it. They may be excused
for not knowing, because very few people did know,
fortunately for our safes and strong boxes, that the mode of
picking Bramah’s and Chubb’s locks, by which the transatlantic
Hobbs gained so much glory, was suggested and explained in
the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> nearly twenty years ago. But it
does seem very strange that they, or at least their reporter,
should not have known, long before the Report finally left his
hands, that Hobbs had picked both of those locks, and taught
every lock-picker in England how to do it, if he possesses the
requisite tools and fingers. Of course, however, the reporter
did not know it, as nobody could read any newspaper last
autumn without knowing it. And this jury did exercise their
judgment to the extent of declaring that Hobbs’s own lock
(under the name of Day and Newell) ‘seems to be impregnable.’
Notwithstanding all which, they express their inability
to ‘offer any opinion on the comparative security afforded by
the various locks that have come before them.’ The only discrimination
which they venture to make is, that the keys of
Bramah’s and Chubb’s locks are of convenient size, while
Hobbs’s is ponderous and bulky, and his lock complicated;
and they might have added (without any very painful amount
of investigation), enormously expensive, in consequence of its
complication, and probably also more likely, on the same account,
to get out of order and stick fast, and so become rather
inconveniently impregnable&mdash;on the money door of a bank,
for instance,&mdash;than the other two locks, especially Bramah’s.”</p>

<p>In relation to the opinion just given, it may be remarked
that the American lock has shewn no tendencies to get out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
order; if well constructed (and good construction is a <i>sine qua
non</i> in such mechanism), the parts work into and upon each
other with very little friction. In respect to expense, and to
the size of the key, a <i>bank</i>-lock is not one in which economy
would be much studied, security being the great desideratum.
No attempt is made to produce a parautoptic lock of small size
or for cheap purposes. The lock, therefore, must be judged of
with reference to what it undertakes to perform. And this
brings us to notice the attempts made in England to pick the
parautoptic or American bank-lock.</p>

<p>The following were the circumstances connected with Mr.
Garbutt’s attempt to pick the American lock. It is of course
known that a challenge was affixed to the American lock in
the Great Exhibition, and it was this challenge which Mr.
Garbutt accepted. Mr. Garbutt, it may be here observed,
was a working locksmith and engineer; he had been entrusted
by Messrs. Fox and Henderson with the care and adjustment
of the metal check-tables at the pay-places of the Crystal Palace;
he had at a previous period been in the employ of Messrs.
Bramah. We mention these facts only on account of an erroneous
rumour at the time that he was an agent of Messrs.
Bramah in respect to the acceptance of the American challenge;
whereas we believe he acted independently, by and for himself.</p>

<p>On Sept. 10th, 1851, Mr. A. H. Renton, Mr. E. H. Thomson,
and Mr. W. F. Shattuck,&mdash;the first an engineer, and the
other two American exhibitors,&mdash;were appointed arbitrators
to superintend the arrangements, and they met Mr. Garbutt
and Mr. Hobbs at the house No. 20 Knightsbridge. The
following conditions were agreed to:&mdash;That a Newell lock
should be selected, and should be screwed to a wooden box;
that Mr. Garbutt should have access only to the key-hole of
the lock, through which key-hole all his operations for picking
the lock should be conducted; that Mr. Garbutt should have
uninterrupted and exclusive access to the box, between the
hours of nine in the morning and nine in the evening, for
thirty days, beginning on the 11th of September, he having<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
during that time the privilege of introducing one associate,
and the arbitrators reserving to themselves the right of inspecting
the seals placed by them on the box; that, in order
to afford every information concerning the internal arrangement
of the lock, the trial-lock should be taken to pieces in
presence of all the parties; that it should be examined by Mr.
Garbutt; that it should be locked and unlocked with the proper
key by him and by Mr. Hobbs; that it should be fastened
to a box, and the fastenings sealed by the arbitrators; that
the key, when the lock was finally locked, should be sealed
up by the arbitrators and delivered to Mr. Hobbs, who would
retain it until required by the arbitrators to hand it over to
them. That at the expiration of the thirty days, or earlier
in case either of the success or the abandonment of the attempt,
the arbitrators should examine the lock. And, finally, that if
Mr. Garbutt should have succeeded in picking the lock (that
is, in withdrawing the bolt without injuring the lock), the sum
of 200<i>l.</i> should be paid to him by Mr. Hobbs.</p>

<p>In accordance with the above agreement, Mr. Hobbs produced
a parautoptic lock, with ten tumblers, marked No. 8560.
The key and the lock were examined by Mr. Garbutt. The
lock was again put together, affixed to a box, and sealed. Mr.
Hobbs set the bits of the key (ten in number) to an arrangement
chosen by himself, and the lock was then locked by all
parties in succession; the key, after the final locking, being
sealed up and returned to Mr. Hobbs. Mr. Hobbs at the same
time delivered to Mr. Garbutt a similar but smaller lock, which
he was to be allowed to retain during the whole period of the
trial, to assist in rendering him familiar with the construction
of both locks.</p>

<p>On the 11th of October, the day on which the prescribed
period expired, the arbitrators met at the house in question,
when Mr. Garbutt delivered up to them the lock uninjured,
but <i>unopened</i>. The award of the arbitrators was thereupon
given in the following terms: “We therefore hereby certify
that Mr. Garbutt having had uninterrupted and exclusive access<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
to the lock during the period of thirty days, and, availing
himself of the conditions of the agreement, had every facility
for opening the lock that could be obtained without possession
of the true key, has delivered up the same into our hands unopened
and uninjured; and the said lock has been delivered
by us to Mr. Hobbs.”</p>

<p>It will of course be understood that it was one condition
of this enterprise, that the particular combination of bits in
the key wherewith the lock was finally locked should not be
seen by Mr. Garbutt. The key was in the first instance tried
by Mr. Garbutt and by the members of the committee, and
was found to turn readily in the lock; Mr. Hobbs then left
the room, and re-arranged the bits of the key so as to produce
a new combination; he then returned to the room, and locked
the lock with the key in its altered form; he allowed all present
to feel the key turn freely, and then, without allowing
any one to see the combination, wrapped the key up in paper,
in which it was sealed as above described. Whether Mr. Garbutt,
or any one, could have succeeded better by a momentary
glance at the arrangement of the key, was not at that moment
the question: the terms of the challenge were that he should
<i>not</i> see it. What are the circumstances likely to occur if the
operator really has access to the key (provided the bits are not
very numerous) we may shortly explain.</p>

<p>It is necessary to draw a distinction between <i>picking of a
lock</i> and <i>ringing the changes on a permutating key</i>; otherwise
some of the late occurrences connected with locks can hardly
be understood. After the reading of a paper by Mr. Hobbs
before the Society of Arts, a discussion arose, in which it
was stated that the Newell lock had been picked in London.
Mr. Hobbs deemed it necessary to refute this statement. The
report was circulated in many of the London newspapers; and
Mr. Jeremiah Smith, the operator in question, supported it by
his own statement. Under these circumstances Mr. Hobbs,
on April 2, 1852, addressed a letter to the editor of the
<i>Observer</i>; of which the following paragraph was intended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
point out the distinction above mentioned between “picking”
and “ringing the changes:”</p>

<p>“Early last autumn I lent to Mr. Potter, of South Molton
Street, one of my locks, for the purpose of giving him an
opportunity to make himself acquainted with its principle and
construction. After he had had the lock in his possession
several weeks, a report reached me that one of Mr. Potter’s
workmen had picked my lock. I immediately called on Mr.
Potter to ascertain the fact. Mr. Potter informed me that
for the purpose of testing the possibility of opening the lock
by means of an impression taken, or a copy being made of
the true key, Mr. Smith had made a copy of the key by
means of a transfer instrument, which instrument he shewed
me at the time. After the key was made, it was tried, and
found to lock and unlock the lock as readily as the original
key. Mr. Potter then sealed the screws of the lock, changed
the combination of the key, and locked it. Mr. Smith then
took the lock, and with the key that he had made by copying
the original, hit the combination, and unlocked it. The lock
was of the smallest size, having but six tumblers; the number
of changes that could possibly be made were 720. The time
occupied by Mr. Smith, according to his own statement, was
six hours and fifty-five minutes; this, allowing one minute for
each change, would give him time to have made 415 out of
the 720 changes before hitting the right one. I asked Mr.
Smith why he did not use the original key instead of making
a copy? His answer was, that ‘he could change the one he
made faster, as he did not have to screw the bits in.’ Any
person will readily understand the difference between ringing
the combination of a key and picking a lock.”</p>

<p>In other words, the process was this: the operator had
the true key, and might have used either this or one which
he made from it. This would have sufficed for opening almost
any lock ever constructed instantly; but in the American lock
he had to find out which of 720 combinations was the right
one, and he was employed almost seven hours in doing this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
The exploit shewed patience, but had little bearing on the
practical subject of lock-picking.</p>

<p>In March 1852 Mr. Smith put forth an offer to accept
the challenge made by Mr. Hobbs in respect to the Exhibition
lock. Mr. Hobbs agreed to the offer, and chose, as arbitrators
on his part, Mr. Hensman, Engineer to the Bank of England,
and Mr. Appold, inventor of the centrifugal pump which attracted
so much attention at the Great Exhibition. Mr. Hobbs
requested Mr. Smith to appoint arbitrators on his side also;
but this was not done. Mr. Smith, at a meeting held by the
four persons named, expressed a wish that an ordinary commercial
lock should be the one experimented on, instead of
the more complicated test-lock which had been at the Great
Exhibition. This was a departure from the terms of the
original challenge; but Mr. Hobbs waived his objection on
this point, and offered to substitute a bank-lock with ten
tumblers for the Exhibition lock with fifteen, the former being
similar in construction but less complex. Another meeting
was agreed upon, but Mr. Smith did not attend; and the
matter was, by himself, brought to a sudden termination.</p>

<p>To shew the effect of difference in the number of tumblers
and key-bits, we may state that, while, at a minute per change,
it would take twelve hours to go through all the combinations
with a six-bitted key, it would require seven years with a
ten-bitted, and 2,500,000 years with a fifteen-bitted key! So
much for power of combination, in the arithmetical mode of
picking.</p>

<p>We now proceed to notice the violability of sundry minor
locks. It might at first appear that the <i>letter-lock</i> is exceedingly
difficult to pick; and so it unquestionably is, as long as
we merely attend to the chance-medley trials by turning the
rings round and round until we happen to hit upon the right
combination. But there is another mode of solving the riddle,
mechanical rather than arithmetical. A piece of common wire,
bent in the form of the shackle, is put in between the ends
of the lock; the spring or elasticity of the wire tends to force<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
the ends apart; this causes the pins or studs on the rod to
press against the inner edges of the rings. By trying all the
rings in succession, some one of them will be found to bind
or cling more than the others; this is turned round until the
cessation of the bind shews that the notch in the ring has
been brought into its right position relatively to the pin on
the rod. Then another ring which binds more than the rest
is treated in a similar way; until at length all the rings seem
to be so far liberated as to indicate that the notches are in
the right positions. In the dial-lock, similarly, when a pressure
has been brought to bear upon the bolt in the right
direction, a trial of the pointers will soon bring the notch in
each wheel to the required position.</p>

<p>Some short time after the events in London connected with
the lock controversy, Mr. William Brown of Liverpool described
the letter-lock noticed in a former page, characterising
it as a lock which he believed no one could pick. An incident
in the history of this lock was thus narrated in one of the
Liverpool newspapers. “Mr. Hobbs was taken by Mr. Milner
to the office of Messrs. Brown, Shipley, and Co., and shewn
this lock. The safe-door was closed and locked by the cashier
at Mr. Brown’s request; and then Mr. Hobbs began to illustrate
his views of the construction of the lock by manipulation
and explanation, with which the subject of them appeared to
sympathise so entirely and promptly that the door opened in
a few minutes.”</p>

<p>In respect to the picking of the Egyptian lock, the main
difficulty would be in obtaining any false key that would correspond
with the pins of the lock; but this might be accomplished
in a way analogous to that which is practised in many
other cases. If a small piece of wax be laid on a blank key,
the key inserted into the lock, and the blank pressed upwards
against the pin-holes, there would be left an impression of
those holes on the wax; this impression would furnish a guide
to the fabrication of a false key. There is also very little difficulty
in picking this lock by one of the ordinary instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span></p>

<p>For the Yale lock, combining something like the pin-action
of the Egyptian with the cylinder-action of the Bramah locks,
the picking requires the use of an instrument that will fit
between two of the pins, and to the outer end of which is
attached a lever and weight; by this means a pressure is
exerted upon the cylinder in the right direction for it to turn,
and the pins are made to bind. Then, with another instrument,
the pins are felt, and each one moved until it seems to
be relieved from the bind: this indicates that the joint in the
pin coincides with the joint between the two cylinders; and
when all have been similarly treated, the weight acting on the
inner cylinder will turn it. It is evident that this method is
the same in principle as the one applicable to the Bramah
lock.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER X.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">EFFECTS OF THE GREAT EXHIBITION OF 1851 IN IMPROVING
ENGLISH LOCKS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">We have now to refer to the effects of the lock controversy.
It was no doubt annoying to be told, on good authority, that
the machines on which we so much prided ourselves were
wrong in principle; and that our locks, in order to afford the
degree of security which are expected of such contrivances,
must be re-constructed. The grumbling with which the first
part of this proposition was received would alone have sufficed
to lead to a suspicion of its truth, if the large number
of new locks that have actually appeared had not confirmed
it. Whether the second part of the proposition has been fairly
carried out, is a point which must now be considered.</p>

<p>One of the first locks produced during or immediately after
the lock controversy was Mr. Parnell’s, to which the bold term<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
of <i>patent defiance lock</i> is attached. This lock is said to depend
for its security on a mode of arrangement which may best be
described in the inventor’s own words: “Viewing the lock from
its exterior, it presents nothing remarkable; but, upon removing
the plate, it will be seen that all possible access to the mechanism
with false or surreptitious keys is effectually prevented by a solid
cylinder of <i>hardened</i> [?] brass, with protecting wards extending
the whole depth of the lock, and having in the centre the aperture
for the key, which fits to a mathematical nicety so exact as
to preclude the possibility of any second instrument being used
to open it.... This protecting cylinder must revolve
with the key to get to the works; and the moment it passes
from the key-hole in going round to lock or unlock, the solid
portion moves into its place, and so completely closes that
aperture that the point of a pin, or a fine steel-pen, has failed
to be inserted between it and the outer plate or cap, to say
nothing of the utter hopelessness of perforating the metal.</p>

<p>“The cylinder or protecting cap, though it revolves by the
action of the key somewhat in the same way as the cylinder
of the Bramah lock, appears to be intended rather for closing
or protecting the key-hole than for governing the movements
of the bolt. The internal arrangements of the lock
are as follow: Supposing the bolt to be shot, and to be
about to be unlocked, the key, by the time it has made
about one-third of a rotation, meets with a forcible resistance
in the shape of an upright spring-bolt or detector of strong
steel acting on the revolving cylinder. The key passes this
detector, and arrives at the levers or tumblers. In the bolt-stud
which works in the slot of these tumblers there is a
small deep serrated notch on one side, corresponding to similar
notches on each of the tumblers; if, therefore, the bolt be
forced, these notches would lock into each other in a similar
manner to the catch on a ship’s windlass or a hoisting crane.
There is also a double-action tumbler-bolt, so adjusted, that if
any of the tumblers be overlifted, this little appendage becomes
thrust down at one end into the bolt of the lock, where it<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
wedges all fast until the tumblers become properly re-adjusted.
The double-action tumbler-bolt also falls into the lock-bolt
when the latter is locked or shut, thereby imparting an additional
strength to the lock. The key has a power of expansion
or enlargement while turning in the lock; it meets with an eccentric
plate which draws out the bits somewhat; so that, at the
moment of acting on the tumblers, they protrude farther from
the pipe of the key than when the key entered the key-hole.
The key is, in fact, larger when in than when out of the lock.
There is connected with the works of the lock a ‘detention-cap,’
so formed that, in the event of a false key being used, a
powerful bolt instantly locks into the revolving cylinder, and
holds fast the surreptitious instrument.” Such is, in substance,
the account which Mr. Parnell has given of his own lock. It
must, however, be stated, that the points of security or novelty
claimed by Mr. Parnell for his lock were patented by previous
inventors. The revolving cylinder or curtain was claimed
by Mitchell and Lawton in the patent of 7th March, 1815, as
noticed at <a href="#Page52">page 52</a> <i>ante</i>. The expanding key-bit was claimed
by Mr. Machin of Wolverhampton in 1827, as noticed at
<a href="#Page61">page 61</a>, and by Mr. Mackinnon (<a href="#Page62">page 62</a>); while the serrated
notches in the tumbler were used by many lock-makers long
before the date of Mr. Parnell’s patent. The detention-cap for
catching and holding a false key when put into the lock was
also patented by Mitchell and Lawton, as noticed at <a href="#Page53">page
53</a> <i>ante</i>.</p>

<p>We come now to notice a lock lately invented by Mr. E.
B. Denison (the author of the <i>Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks</i>
in this series), which has the merit of combining considerable
novelty in construction with security. After the details given
in the two preceding chapters, it will certainly be no small
praise when we express our conviction that in the present state
of the art of lock-picking, this lock may be considered as secure.
Mr. Denison has furnished us with a description of his lock,
which we insert almost in his own words. Mr. Denison claims
for this lock the following advantages:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span></p>

<p>1. That a very large and strong lock on this construction
only requires a very small key. 2. That no key is required
to lock it, although it is free from the inconvenience pertaining
to spring-locks, viz. that the door cannot be shut without locking
itself. Moreover this lock is more secure than any spring-lock
can be. 3. That it cannot get out of order from the
usual causes of the tumblers sticking together or their springs
breaking, inasmuch as the action of the tumblers does not
depend on any thing but the key and the handle, and there are
no tumbler-springs. 4. That for the same reason, the parts of
this lock do not require any polishing or delicacy of execution.
5. That the key-hole being completely closed by a curtain, except
when the key is in, the lock is protected from the effects
of the atmosphere and dust entering at the key-hole. 6. That
this lock is secure against any known mode of picking; the
smallness of the key-hole prevents the insertion of any instrument
strong enough to open the lock by violence. 7. That
this lock, from the simplicity of its construction, admits of
being made at small cost.</p>

<p>These objects are accomplished as follows:&mdash;In the large-sized
locks, such as would be used for safes and large doors,
the tumblers <span class="smcapall">T</span>, <a href="#Fig51">fig. 51</a>, are made of pieces of hoop-iron, 6 or 7
inches long and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch wide: these tumblers are supported by
and turn on a pin <i>a</i>, placed at about the middle of their length;
so that being balanced on the pin, or nearly so, and having
their separating plates <span class="smcapall">P</span> between them, which cannot turn, the
tumblers will stand in any position indifferently; and in order
to secure sufficient friction to keep them steady, one or more
of the separating plates <span class="smcapall">P</span> is bent a little, so as to act as a spring
when the cap of the lock is screwed down. The lock is shewn
in <a href="#Fig51">fig. 51</a> as locked, the bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span> having been shot by the fantailed
piece <i>f</i> on the handle, and the tumblers sent down, so
that the stump <i>s</i> cannot enter their jaws by the other piece of
the handle; and it is evident that the handle cannot draw the
bolt back again until the tumblers have all been raised by the
key to the proper position to allow the stump <i>s</i> to enter their<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
jaws. It will be observed that in the position shewn in the
<a href="#Fig51">figure</a>, the stump does not touch the tumblers; and consequently,
so long as the bolt is kept in the position represented, no
pressure of the stump against the tumblers can be felt, although
by means of a false key or pick-lock the tumblers be raised to
any height. No implement, however, can be pushed into the
key-hole without first pressing in the curtain <span class="smcapall">K</span>, which is held
up against the cap of the lock by the two spiral springs <i>c c</i> on
each side of the key-hole; and at the back of the curtain there
is a square plug <i>p</i>, which goes through a hole in the back of
the lock, and has a notch in it through which the bolt can pass
when the curtain is up, closing the key-hole, but at no other
time. In other words, the act of pushing in the key sends
down the curtain plug, the effect of which is to hold the bolt
fast in the position in which the stump cannot be made to touch
the tumblers. If the proper key be used and turned about
half round to the right, it will bring the tumblers to the
proper height for the stump to pass. The key is then taken
out; for so long as it is in the lock, the bolt cannot be moved;
and then turning the handle to the right, the bolt is drawn and
the door opened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig51">
<img src="images/illo144.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 51. Mr. Denison’s large lock.</p>
</div>

<p>The handle <span class="smcapall">H</span> should be so made,
that as soon as the fantailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
piece <i>f</i> has sent the bolt just clear of the tumblers, the
other arm to the right of <span class="smcapall">H</span> may begin to move the tumblers; but
the fantail need not send the stump above one-sixteenth of an
inch beyond the tumblers; and the curtain-plug and bolt must
be so adjusted that the curtain cannot be pushed in until the
bolt is so far out that the stump is this one-sixteenth of an inch
beyond the tumblers. The curtain <span class="smcapall">K</span> need only be a thin piece
of steel, and the bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span> must be thick enough for the curtain to
go down just to the level of the thin plate <span class="smcapall">P</span> between the bolt
and the first tumbler <span class="smcapall">T</span>. The curtain-plug <i>p</i> is made as long
as the key-hole and rather broader, and of the shape represented,
partly for the sake of steadiness in pushing in the
curtain, and also for more completely protecting the key-hole;
for if an attempt be made to pick the lock by drilling into the
key-hole, the drill will pass into the inside of the door and not
into the inside of the lock.<a id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote10"></a><a href="#FNanchor10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
Mr. Denison informs us that there is a further contrivance, which he
will explain privately to any persons who wish to manufacture these locks,
of which the object is, not to add any thing to the security of the lock under
ordinary circumstances, but to provide against the unusual case of a very
dexterous thief having occasional access to the lock when open; in which
case (but for some such further provision) he might manage to construct a
false key capable of opening the lock at any other time, by a method which,
for obvious reasons, it is not advisable to publish.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is true that iron safes have been made for some years in
which any number of large bolts are shot by a handle and then
locked by a very small key. But in such locks the key must
be used in locking, and this leads to certain objections, viz.
the key must occasionally at least be confided to some person
whose duty it is to lock up the safe after the owner has left
the place; there is also the temptation to leave the key in the
lock, since it will be wanted in locking up; and thus there is
the danger of some dishonest person taking an impression of
the key. Besides this, the real strength and security of such
safes is only that due to the small lock which locks into the
main bolt; whereas in Mr. Denison’s lock the security and
strength are those due to the lock itself, with its large and<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
strong tumblers, and other provisions peculiar to its construction;
and the key for a lock of the largest size, which was
lately exhibited at the Society of Arts by Messrs. S. Mordan
and Co., the makers, only weighs a little more than a quarter
of an ounce. It may be mentioned that for large locks the key
may be solid, although in the small ones it is more convenient
to have a pipe-key, on account of the different construction of
the curtain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig52">
<img src="images/illo146.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">fig. 52. Mr. Denison’s small lock.</p>
</div>

<p>The arrangement of the small lock for drawers, &amp;c. is
somewhat different from that of the large ones, and will be
understood by referring to <a href="#Fig52">fig. 52</a>. The action of the handle
<span class="smcapall">H</span> on the bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span>
and on the tumblers <span class="smcapall">T</span> is sufficiently clear from
the figure. The curtain in this case has no plug, but is only
a flat plate held up by a thin spring behind it, and moving
up and down on the drill-pin of the key, and kept from turning
by having one edge against the side of the lock. The bolt
has a kind of second stump, only coming up so high as to be
able just to pass under the corner of the curtain when it is up,
but not able to pass when the curtain is at all pressed down by
any thing inserted in the key-hole. In a drawer lock the key
has only to be turned a quarter round in order to raise the
tumblers. In small locks, the friction of the tumbler-plates is<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
quite enough to keep them in any position, without putting the
pin in the middle so as to balance them, as in large locks with
heavy tumblers.</p>

<p>In the making of these locks the key must be made first,
with proper provisions to prevent the repetition of the same
pattern; a kind of pattern or model for locks of each size
should be made; the tumblers put on the pin with plates of
the intended thickness between, and when raised by the key to
the proper height they should be clamped down; and the
jaws for the stump of the bolt may then be cut by a circular
saw moving in a slit in the model corresponding to the place of
the stump. The tumblers for large locks may be cut off from
a strip of hoop-iron to the proper lengths by a stamping cutter,
giving them the proper circular end, and a punch might at the
same time make the pin-hole in the middle. The tumblers for
small locks should be stamped out of sheet brass or iron.</p>

<p>It will thus be evident that from the general simplicity of
construction, and the small amount of finish required in the
working parts, this lock can be made at small cost. We
may also add that this lock is as creditable to the public spirit
as to the mechanical skill of the inventor; for the lock is not
patented, patents being, in Mr. Denison’s estimation, obstructions
to the progress of science.</p>

<p>The next result of the “lock controversy” which we have
to notice is the production of not less than three improved locks
by Messrs. Chubb. We thought it our duty to invite the
attention of this celebrated firm to the preparation of this
<i>Rudimentary Treatise</i>, and in answer to the application of
our publisher we received the following communication from
Messrs. Chubb, which we insert verbatim:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It will not be necessary to describe the lock as originally
made, as a description of it will be found in Mr. Chubb’s
paper read before the Institution of Civil Engineers.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lock No. 1.</span>&mdash;The first of the improvements introduced
consists of a barrel, to which a circular curtain is attached,
revolving round the drill-pin in the lock; so that if any instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
is introduced to attempt to pick it, the curtain immediately
closes up the key-hole, and prevents the introduction
of any auxiliary instruments, there being several required in
action at once to produce any effect.</p>

<p>“If by any means these several instruments can be introduced
simultaneously, the barrel keeps them all confined in a
very small space, preventing their expansion, and renders it
impossible to work them independently of each other; therefore
they are of no avail, being incapable of acting as more than a
single pick, which is perfectly useless. The barrel and curtain
have each been previously used <i>separately</i> in locks, but until
patented by Mr. De la Fons in 1846 they had not been used
<i>in combination</i>. Neither of them, used separately, is of much
use, but when combined they afford a very great security.
Locks have been, and still are shewn, containing either the
barrel or curtain <i>singly</i>, and as these have been picked, it has
been asserted that the improvement now introduced in Chubb’s
lock is equally insecure; but a slight examination of the difference
in their construction will prove the contrary. Mr.
Chubb has purchased the patent-right of this part of Mr. De
la Fons’ invention, and applies it to all his locks.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lock No. 2.</span>&mdash;The next improvement, recently patented
by Mr. Chubb, is based upon the assumption that there may
be a possibility of overcoming the security of the barrel and
curtain as already described (although this assumption is not
in the slightest degree admitted), and consists in applying what
is called a ‘tumbler-bolt,’ working on a hinge connected with
the main bolt. The web of the key does not in any case touch
the main bolt in unlocking, but acts only on the tumbler-bolt.
All the tumblers must first be lifted, each to its proper position,
before the tumbler-bolt will act. Should any pressure be applied
to either bolt before the tumblers are all at their exact
position, the effect would be to throw the bolts out of gear, and
thus effectually to stop the stump of the main bolt from passing
through the racks of the tumblers. None of the many plans of
picking which have been suggested, such as smoked key-blanks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
thin key-bits, &amp;c., would be of the least avail against a lock
made on this principle. Different kinds of detectors may be
applied to these locks. It is submitted that this lock, retaining
all the simplicity and durability which have distinguished
Chubb’s lock for so many years, and combining with them
these important improvements, affords a complete security
against all surreptitious attempts of any nature. Locks on
the same principle are being made on the permutation plan,
with any number of tumblers, and any number of changes in
combination that may be desired.</p>

<p>“It has been suggested that the ‘detector,’ instead of giving
additional security to Chubb’s lock, affords a partial guidance
to a person attempting to pick it. This objection holds good
to a certain extent in these locks as originally made, in which
all the tumblers had an <i>equal</i> bearing against the detector-stump;
but in the locks as now constructed this objection is
entirely obviated, by giving the tumblers an <i>unequal</i> bearing,
whereby, if an operator feels the obstruction of the detector-stump,
he cannot tell whether the tumbler which he is lifting
is raised too high, or not high enough.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lock No. 3.</span>&mdash;For banks, Mr. Chubb has introduced what
he particularly calls his ‘bank lock.’ It contains a barrel with
a series of curtains. While the key-hole is open, all access to
the tumblers from the key-hole is completely cut off by two
sliding pieces of solid metal, which fit closely on either side of
the barrel. These pieces are acted upon by an eccentric motion,
so that when the key is applied to the lock, and turned
in it, the key-hole is shut up by the revolution of the curtains,
and then only do the sliding pieces of metal move aside to allow
the key to act upon the tumblers. These pieces return to their
position when the key has passed; therefore, while the key is
lifting the tumblers, all communication is cut off from the exterior
of the lock by these sliding pieces and the series of
curtains. The bolt is made in two pieces, the main bolt never
being in contact with the key, which acts only on the talon-bolt,
and by it transmits the motion to the main bolt. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
the action of locking, the talon-bolt is partly repelled, and a
lever or ‘dog’ connected with it locks into a series of combinations
arranged upon the front parts of the tumblers, and holds
them securely down, so that none of them can be lifted in the
least degree until the talon-bolt is thrown forward to release
them, If, therefore, any pressure be applied to this talon-bolt,
to endeavour by its help to ascertain the combinations of the
tumblers, it will only the more tightly lock them down, and
render the attempt ineffectual. By another contrivance it is
rendered impracticable to move a pick or picks round in the
lock more than a small distance, unless the tumblers could
previously be all lifted to their right positions, which can only
be done by the right key. Should one or more of the tumblers
be surreptitiously raised by any possible means, they cannot
be detained in this uplifted position, for the action of turning
back the pick to try to raise another tumbler sets in motion a
lever which allows the tumblers already raised to drop to their
former position, leaving the operator just as far from the attainment
of his object as at the outset.”</p>

<p>Such is the statement with which Messrs. Chubb have favoured
us respecting their three new locks. We are willing to
admit the enterprising spirit which has led to their production,
and the ingenuity which has been bestowed on their construction;
but whether they mark a step in advance in the art of
lock-making may perhaps admit of doubt. With respect to
the lock No. 1, we would remark, that locks with the barrel
and curtain combined were made by Mr. Aubin of Wolverhampton
in 1833, and that a specimen of such a lock was
exhibited on his stand of locks in the Great Exhibition.
Locks with the combined barrel and curtain were also made
and sold by Mr. Jones of Newark, N.J., as stated at <a href="#Page104">p. 104</a>.</p>

<p>With respect to the lock No. 2, the object of the <i>tumbler-bolt</i>
is evidently intended to produce the same effect as the
<i>movable stump</i> in Mr. Hobbs’s protector-lock, <a href="#Fig47">fig. 47</a>, page 100;
but with greater complexity in the construction, there is less
efficiency in the action of this part of Mr. Chubb’s lock as<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
compared with that of Mr. Hobbs, inasmuch as a pressure
of the stump against the tumblers, corresponding with
the strength of the spring which holds the bolt in its place,
can always be produced, thereby giving friction, and affording
indication as to which tumbler it is that is in tight contact with
the stump.</p>

<p>With respect to the barrel and curtains of lock No. 3, and
all similar contrivances, the object of which is said to be to
prevent the entrance into the key-hole of all instruments except
the proper key, we would offer the self-evident remark,
that the same aperture which admits the key will also admit
some other instrument. In the case of Mr. Chubb’s “bank-lock,”
it may be questioned whether the revolving curtain, &amp;c.
give it any advantage over the other locks already referred to
which are furnished with similar contrivances. The effect of
the <i>talon-bolt</i> in this lock appears to be the same as that of the
false notches, namely, to hold the tumblers in the position in
which they were placed when the pressure was applied. Hence,
a pressure applied to the talon-bolt affects the parts which
come in contact with the key in the act of locking and unlocking;
and this circumstance brings the lock under the application
of the principle stated at page 99, and thus, if this principle
be admitted, may render the security of the lock somewhat
questionable.</p>

<p>Various other locks have been brought out since the date
of the “lock controversy” in the year 1851. We would gladly
notice them all, did they shew novelty of design and mark an
advance in the art of the locksmith. We must, however, admire
the ingenuity with which Mr. Hobbs’s movable stump
has been more or less adopted; but in the attempts to imitate
it the objection has not been removed, that it is possible to
produce on the tumblers a pressure or friction equal to the
strength of the spring which holds the tumblers down.</p>

<p>There is, however, a lock which has lately been introduced
to the public, which calls for special notice, on account of the
high honours which have been bestowed upon it. We refer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
the prize lock of the Society of Arts, London, the invention of
Mr. H. J. Saxby of Sheerness, who has received the Society’s
medal and the sum of ten guineas as the reward of his ingenuity.
The interior of this lock consists of a cylinder with four
pins or slides radiating from the centre, and pressed into the
key-hole by means of spiral springs. The pins project beyond
the periphery of the wheel or cylinder, and into slots in a ring
which is affixed to the case of the lock, thereby preventing the
cylinder from being turned. On each pin is a notch, so placed
that when the proper key is inserted into the key-hole, the
notches on the several pins will be brought into a position
such as will allow the cylinder to turn. The turning of the
cylinder in this, as in the Bramah lock, shoots the bolt.</p>

<p>A lock on precisely the same principle, but more secure in
its construction, was described by Mr. Hobbs in a paper read
by him before the Society of Arts in January 1852, when diagrams
illustrative of the same were exhibited. This paper was
not reported at any length in the journal of the Society’s proceedings;
but the same paper was read by Mr. Hobbs, March 1,
1852, before the Liverpool Polytechnic Society, and a full report
thereof, and a description of the lock in question, is given
in the “Transactions” of that Society, from September 1849
to December 1852 (8vo, Liverpool, 1853). This lock is no
other than the Yale lock already noticed at page 83, and is
thus described at page 196 of the “Transactions:”</p>

<p>“Another description of cylinder-lock was invented, a few
years since, by a Mr. Yale of the State of New York, U.S.A.</p>

<p>“The Yale lock has two cylinders, one working within the
other; and they are held together by a series of pins reaching
through the cylinders into the key-hole, which is in the centre.
On the back of the inner cylinder is a pin that fits into a slot
in the bolt, and moves it as the cylinder is turned. The pins
that hold the cylinders together and prevent the inner one
from turning, are cut in two at different lengths. The key
is so made, that by inserting it into the key-hole the pins
are moved, so that the joint in the pins meets the joint between<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
the cylinders, and allows the inner one to be turned.
But, as with the slides of the Bramah lock, should any one of
the pins be pushed too far, the cylinder is held quite as firmly
as though it had not been touched. Some of these locks have
been made with as many as forty pins; and to a person unacquainted
with the principles on which locks are picked, they
would seem to present an insurmountable barrier.</p>

<p>“For the purpose of picking the lock, an instrument is made
that will fit between two of the pins; to that is attached a lever
and weight, thereby getting a pressure on the cylinder and
causing the pins to bind; then with another instrument the
pins are felt, and as they are found to bind, they are pressed
in until they are relieved (as they will be when the joint comes
to the right place), thereby easily opening the lock. There is
a great similarity in the operation and security of this and the
lock manufactured by Mr. Cotterill of Birmingham.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Society of Arts Journal</i> for the 24th June, 1853, is
a letter from Mr. Hobbs on the subject of the prize lock, which,
it appears, he picked, “in the presence of parties connected
with the Society, in the short space of three minutes.”</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER XI.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE LOCK AND KEY MANUFACTURE.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The manufacture of locks and keys, considered as a department
of working in iron, is one that requires, and indeed
admits of, very little description. The hammer, the file, the
drill, the fly-press, are the chief instruments employed; the
iron itself being brought to something like the desired state
and form by rolling or casting, or both. But the manufacture
is interesting in its social features&mdash;in its relation to the persons
employed and the buildings occupied. One by one, several
departments of industry have progressed from the <i>handicraft</i>
to the <i>factory</i> system&mdash;from that system in which a man and
a few apprentices work in a small shop in the lockmaker’s
garret or kitchen, to that in which organisation is maintained
among twenty or fifty or a hundred men. Locks have scarcely
yet passed out of the first stage, but there is no good reason
whatever why they should so remain; there are as many reasons
for progress in this as in other arts, and indications are
not wanting that some such progress will be made.</p>

<p>So far as England is concerned, the neighbourhood of
Wolverhampton is the great storehouse whence locks are obtained.
Eminent lock-makers reside in London and in other
principal towns; but Wolverhampton is regarded by all as the
centre of the trade. This is not a modern localisation, for
we have information respecting the locks of Wolverhampton a
century and a quarter ago. Among the Harleian Manuscripts
is an account of “The Voyage of Don Manuel Gonzales (late
merchant), of the City of Lisbon in Portugal, to Great Britain:
containing an Historical, Geographical, Topographical, Political,
and Ecclesiastical Account of England and Scotland;
with a Curious Collection of things particularly rare, both in
Nature and Antiquity.” This Ms. appears to have been written<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
about 1732; it was translated from the Portuguese, and
printed in Pinkerton’s Collection of Voyages and Travels.
With reference to Wolverhampton, Gonzales says: “The chief
manufacturers of this town are locksmiths, who are reckoned
the most expert of that trade in England. They are so curious
in this art, that they can contrive a lock so that if a servant
be sent into the closet with the master-key, or their own, it
will shew how many times that servant hath gone in at any
distance of time, and how many times the lock has been shot
for a whole year; some of them being made to discover five
hundred or a thousand times. We are informed also that
a very fine lock was made in this town, sold for 20<i>l.</i>, which
had a set of chimes in it that would go at any hour the owner
should think fit.” If Gonzales were correct in these descriptions,
they indicate an exercise of considerable ingenuity in
lock-construction, especially in reference to the lock which
keeps a registry of the number of times it has been opened.
There is abundant evidence that the old lock-makers were
very fond of these knick-knack locks, which would do all
sorts of strange and unexpected things; and this may in part
account for the great favour in which locks have been held by
amateur machinists.</p>

<p>The lock-manufacture in South Staffordshire is of a remarkable
character, comprised as it is within so small an area.
Although Wolverhampton is known commercially as the chief
depôt of the English lock trade, yet it is at Willenhall, three
or four miles eastward of that town, that the actual manufacture
is chiefly carried on. When the Commission was appointed
a few years ago to inquire into the condition of children
employed in trades and manufactures, Mr. R. H. Horne was
deputed to examine the Wolverhampton district; and his report
is too curious, and too closely connected with our present
subject, to be passed unnoticed. We here give an abstract of
such parts of his report as bear reference to the lock-makers
of Willenhall.</p>

<p>Almost the entire industry of Willenhall is in the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
articles of currycombs, locks and keys, and articles connected
incidentally with locks, such as bolts and latches. At the
time Mr. Horne wrote, in 1841, there were among the master
manufacturers 268 locksmiths, 76 key-makers, 14 bolt-makers,
and 13 latch-makers; besides many small masters living in
such out-of-the-way corners that they escaped enumeration.
In the <i>Post-Office Directory</i> of that district, of later date, there
are entries of rather a curious character. In the first place it
is observable that different kinds of locks are made by different
persons, each manufacturer confining his operations apparently
to one kind of lock; one is a <i>rim-lock</i> maker, another a
<i>trunk-lock</i> maker, a third a <i>cabinet-lock</i> maker, a fourth a <i>padlock</i>
maker, a fifth a <i>mortice-lock</i> maker, and so on. But a
much more singular feature is, that lock-making is combined
with retail dealing of a totally different kind; thus among the
occupations put down opposite the names of individuals are,
“key-stamper and beer-retailer,” “door-lock maker and beer-retailer,”
“grocer and trunk-lock maker,” “Malt-Shovel tavern-keeper
and rim-lock maker,” “lock-maker and provision-dealer,”
“grocer and key-maker,” “cabinet-lock maker and
Woolpack tavern,” “key-stamper and registrar of births, &amp;c.,”
“Hope and Anchor and cabinet-lock maker,” “auctioneer and
locksmith,” “rim-lock and varnish maker,” and so forth. It
is probable that in some of these cases the wife attends to the
retail shop, while the husband attends to the workshop.</p>

<p>Among all the lock-manufacturers of the town there are
scarcely half a dozen in what may be termed a large way of
business; there are many who employ from five to fifteen pairs
of hands, but the great majority are small masters who are
themselves working mechanics, and are aided by apprentices
from one to four in number, perhaps two on an average. Mr.
Horne thinks that there were not fewer than a thousand boys
at work in the town, chiefly upon locks and keys. The children
and young persons are employed at all ages, from seven
up to manhood; from the earliest age, indeed, in which they
are able to hold a file. It is a characteristic fact, where so<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
many of the male inhabitants are employed at the bench from
such early years, that a certain distortion of figure is observable;
the right shoulder-blade becomes displaced and projects,
and the right leg crooks and bends inwards at the knee, like
the letter K,&mdash;it is the leg which is hindermost in standing
at the vice. The right hand also has frequently a marked distortion.
“Almost every thing it holds takes the position of the
file. If the poor man carries a limp lettuce or a limper mackarel
from Wolverhampton market, they are never dangled, but
always held like the file. If he carry nothing, his right hand
is in just the same position.”</p>

<p>The hours of labour among the small masters are scarcely
brought within any system at all; for all the work is piecework,
not paid for by the day or hour; and each man works
as long as he likes, or as long as his business impels him.
Some will file away from four or five in the morning till eleven
or twelve at night. In the larger shops, where there are many
hands employed, they come to work when they like, leave
when they like, and do as much work as they like when there;
this freedom of action being spread over a working-day of
perhaps sixteen hours. The masters say that the men prefer
this system, or want of system, to any thing more precise and
regular. In the beginning of the week there is often much
idleness and holiday-keeping; and the Willenhall men make
up for this by a day of sixteen, eighteen, or even twenty hours’
work towards the end of the week. In the beginning of the
week, men and boys have defined hours and definite periods
for meals; but towards the end of the week, when hurry and
drive are the order of the day, they eat their meals while at
work, and bolt their victuals standing. “You see a locksmith
and his two apprentices, with a plate before each of them,
heaped up (at the best of times, when they can get such
things) with potatoes and lumps of something or other, but
seldom meat, and a large slice of bread in one hand; your
attention is called off for two minutes, and on turning round
again, you see the man and boys filing at the vice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span></p>

<p>In the processes as carried on at Willenhall, they are applied
chiefly to the manufacture of mortice, box, trunk, rim,
cabinet, case, bright, dead, closet, and padlocks. Except some
of the parts of the brass-work, which are <i>cast</i>, these locks are
made by <i>forging</i>, <i>pressing</i>, and <i>filing</i>. The forging is a light kind
of smith’s work, aided by a light hammer and a small pair of
bellows; children and young persons are largely employed in
this process. Pressing is a kind of work by which certain
parts of the lock are pressed or stamped out. The presses are
of various sizes, but all require much strength to work them;
the press has a horizontal lever, crossing the top of a vertical
screw, and there is generally an iron weight at the end of each
arm or half of the lever to increase the power; one of the lever
arms is grasped in the right hand of the presser, and whirled
round with a jerk; while the fingers of the left hand place the
metal in its proper position, and remove it when it has been
stamped or pressed. There is, of course, a die or cutter
attached to the press, to cut the metal in the proper form.
Sometimes the press has only one arm to the lever, and no
weight at the end of this, so that the labour of working is
much increased. Children and youths are employed at this
process, so far as their strength will admit. The last process,
<i>filing</i>, is that by which the separate pieces are shaped and
smoothed for adjustment in their proper places; here children
and youths are almost exclusively employed; they stand upon
blocks so as to be able to reach the vice, and then work away
with the file, unrelieved by any change in the nature of the
process.</p>

<p>In key-making the processes may be said to comprise
<i>forging</i>, <i>stamping</i>, <i>piercing</i>, and <i>filing</i>. The forging differs very
little from that required in making the pieces for a lock. The
stamping is effected by placing the end of an iron wire, taken
red-hot from the forge, into one half of a key-mould made in
a block or kind of anvil; a heavy weight is then raised between
an upright framework, in the grooves of which it runs
by means of a cord; the cord is drawn by both hands, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
the assistance of one foot in a stirrup attached to the end of
the cord; at the bottom of the weight thus raised is the other
half of the key-mould. Such being the nature of the stamping
apparatus, the process is thus conducted: the foot in the
stirrup being suddenly raised, and the cord loosed, the weight
falls upon the red-hot wire, and the blow stamps it into the
two moulds or half-moulds, which are brought accurately together
by means of the slides or side-grooves in the framework.
The rough key is also trimmed and cleared by the
pressing apparatus; that is, the surplus metal all round is
cut off by a single blow; and the metal which fills up the ring
or handle of the key is cut or pressed out in the same way.
This is a heavy part of the key-work, for which the labour of
men rather than that of boys is required. The process of
<i>piercing</i> the key consists in making the pipe or barrel, required
for most keys, except those which are intended to open a lock
for both sides; the pipe is drilled by a small machine worked
with the foot like a lathe; it is a process requiring more skill
than strength, relatively to other parts of the manufacture.
The <i>filing</i> of a key is important; for not only is the whole key
made bright, but the wards are cut by the file and chisel.
Boys and youths are employed in filing the common keys; but
those of better quality are entrusted to men.</p>

<p>The apprenticeship system is carried on to a remarkable
extent among the lock and key makers of Willenhall. The
small masters take apprentices at any age at which they can
work. Some of them employ only apprentices, never paying
wages for journeymen, but always taking on a new apprentice
as soon as a former one is out of his time. The boys are
mostly procured from other towns, and they bring with them a
small apprenticeship-fee and a suit or two of clothes. They
are bound to the masters by legal indenture or contract; and
the masters board and lodge and clothe them during their
apprenticeship. One consequence of this system is, that when
the apprentice has served his time, he is almost driven to become
a small master himself from want of employment as a journeyman;<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
and he then takes apprentices as his master did before
him. This accounts for the fact that in Willenhall there
are few large manufacturers and few journeymen; while there
is a constantly-increasing number of small masters and of apprentices.</p>

<p>The Willenhall makers nearly all look to the Wolverhampton
factors or dealers for a market for their wares&mdash;so
far at least as concerns locks and keys; there are some other
articles which they sell more frequently to Birmingham houses.
The master and an apprentice, or perhaps two, generally
trudge off to Wolverhampton on a Saturday, bearing the stock
of locks which he may have to sell; and the money receipts for
the locks or keys sold are usually in part spent at the large
market of Wolverhampton previous to the homeward journey.
The Willenhall men take contracts at so low a price as to prevent
the competition of other places; it is stated, that whatever be
prices elsewhere, nothing can come below the Willenhall prices
for cheap locks. The men work hard for small returns, and yet
they have a strong yearning for their own town. A Willenhall
girl will seldom marry except to a townsman; and thus
they intermarry to an extent which maintains their characteristics
as a peculiar community. As an example of their disinclination
to leave their own town, Mr. Horne states the following
circumstance: “Some years ago a factor, who had
projected a manufactory in Brussels, engaged some five-and-twenty
Willenhall men, whom he was at the expense of taking
over. He gave them all work, and from hard-earned wages
of from 9<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a-week, these ‘practised hands’ found
themselves able to earn 3<i>l.</i> a-week and upwards. But they
were not satisfied, and began to feel uncomfortable; first one
left, and returned home; then another; then one or two; till,
in the course of a few weeks, every man had returned to Willenhall”&mdash;there
to work harder and earn less.</p>

<p>It is just possible that the application of the factory system
to lock-making may first become important by making the <i>best</i>
locks cheaper than they can be made by the handicraft method;<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
for there seems not much probability, at least for a great length
of time to come, that any new system will be able to compete
with Willenhall in the common locks&mdash;those of which more
thousands are sold than there are tens of the better locks. In
this, however, it would not do to predict rashly. Hand-loom
weaving is cheap enough, unfortunately for those who practise
it; but yet the factory system comes down as low as the lowest
hand-loom weaving.</p>

<p>The editor of Hebert’s <i>Encyclopædia</i>, after noticing the
facilities for opening most locks by copying the key, makes
the following announcement: “It affords the editor of this
work much satisfaction to state, that he has in his possession
a lock, the key of which <i>cannot be copied</i>, a locksmith possessing
no tools by which an exactly similar one can be made;
the machine by which the original one was made is so arranged
as to be deprived of the power of producing another like it.
The lock is very simple, very strong, and can be very cheaply
made. The cost of a complete machine to make them would
be about 100<i>l.</i>; with that they might be manufactured at one-half
the expense of any patent lock. The inventor is desirous
to have the subject brought before the public under a patent;
but want of time to devote himself to such an object at present
obliges him to lay it aside.” The invention not being patented,
the editor of course gave no diagram or engraving of the lock
or machine; nor does there appear to have been a patent obtained
during the sixteen or eighteen years which have elapsed
since the above notice was published. There are, however,
mechanical principles sufficiently well known to lead to a belief
that such a machine is practicable; a ticket-printing or
numbering machine will, in printing 100,000 tickets, produce
such variations that no two impressions shall be identical; and
a key-making machine might, after fashioning a particular
part of each key, modify the arrangement of certain wheels
and pinions so far as to produce a slightly different result
when the next key is to be operated on.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of locks and keys generally, there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
no reason why the factory system should not, to a certain extent,
be applicable. By this will be understood, the production
of similar parts by tools or machines, graduated in respect to
each other with more care than can be done by the hand method.
If we suppose that a lock of particular construction
comprises twenty screws and small pieces of metal, and that
there are required, for general disposal in the market, five
sizes of such a lock; there would thus be a hundred pieces
of metal required for the series, each one differing, either in
shape or size, from every one of the others. Now, on the factory
or manufacturing system, as compared with the handicraft
system, forging, drawing, casting, stamping, and punching,
would supersede much of the filing; the drilling machine
would supersede the drill-stock and bow, and other machines
would supersede other hand-worked tools. This would be
done&mdash;not merely because the work could be accomplished
more quickly or more cheaply&mdash;but because an accuracy of
adjustment would be attained, such as no hand-work could
equal, unless it be such special work as would command a
high rate of payment. For any one size in the series, and
any one piece of metal in each size of lock, a standard would
be obtained which could be copied to any extent, and all the
copies would be like each other. To pursue our illustration,
the manufacturer might have a hundred boxes or drawers,
and might supply each with a hundred copies of the particular
piece of metal to which it is appropriated, all so exactly
alike that any one copy might be taken as well as any
other. Ten pieces, one from each of ten of these boxes, would
together form a lock; ten, one from each of another ten boxes,
would form a second lock, and so on; and there would be, in
the whole of the boxes, materials for a thousand locks of one
construction, a hundred of each size.</p>

<p>Now the advantage of the machine or factory mode of
producing such articles is this, that they can be made in
large numbers at one time, whenever the steam-engine is at
work; and that when so made, the pieces are shaped so exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
alike, the screws have threads so identical, and the holes are
bored so equal in diameter, that any one of a hundred copies
would act precisely like all the others, thereby giving great
advantages to the men employed in putting the lock together.</p>

<p>These principles are being applied by Messrs. Hobbs and
Co. in their London establishment. A number of machines,
worked by steam-power, are employed in shaping the several
pieces of metal contained in a lock; and all the several
pieces are deposited in labelled compartments, one
to each kind of piece. The machines are employed&mdash;in
some cases to do coarse work, which they can accomplish
more quickly than it can be done by men; and in other cases
to do delicate work, which they can accomplish more accurately
than men; but so far is this from converting the
men into lowly-paid automatons (as some might suppose),
that the manufacturers are better able to pay good wages for
the handicraft labour necessary in putting the locks together,
than for forming the separate parts by hand; just as the
“watchmaker,” as he is called, who puts the separate parts
of the watch together, is a better-paid mechanic than the man
who is engaged in fabricating any particular parts of the
watch.</p>

<p>It may be observed that the system of manufacturing on a
large scale, by many men engaged in one large building, is
more nearly universal in the United States than in England.
The workshop system, as pursued at Willenhall by the lock-makers,
is very little practised in America. Being comparatively
a new community, and being at liberty to select for
imitation or for improvement whichever of the usages or systems
in the old country they may prefer, the Americans have
preferred to adopt the factory system rather than the workshop
system, and to carry out the former to an extent not yet equalled
in England&mdash;not yet equalled, we mean, in the number of trades
to which it is applied.</p>

<h2><span class="h2nr">CHAPTER XII.</span><br />
<span class="h2name">ENGLISH PATENTS FOR LOCKS&mdash;AUBIN’S LOCK TROPHY.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">We propose to conclude this small work with a few details
respecting the various patented inventions in locks, and concerning
Mr. Aubin’s remarkable lock trophy. These two
subjects relate to locks in general, rather than to any specified
constructions in particular, and can on that account more
conveniently be given here than in connexion with any of
the foregoing chapters.</p>

<p>Mr. Chubb, in the appendix to his paper on locks and
keys read before the Institution of Civil Engineers, gave a
useful list of all the patents taken out in England in relation
to this subject, down to the year 1849. We here transcribe
this list:</p>

<p class="center blankbefore75"><i>List of Patents for Locks and Latches granted since the
Establishment of the Patent Laws.</i></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">“As no complete list of the patents granted for locks from
the time of James I. has hitherto been published, it is believed
that the following list, which has been very carefully
drawn up, and which comprises all patents from the year 1774,
when the first patent for a lock was granted, to the present
time, will be found useful as a reference for all who are interested
in the subject.</p>

<p>Among the most curious mechanical productions in the
Great Exhibition of 1851, was one which attracted very little
notice, viz. that forwarded by Mr. C. Aubin of Wolverhampton.
Whether it was that attention, so far as regards locks, was too
much absorbed by the “lock controversy,” or whether there
was a deficiency of descriptive cataloguing, no juror or newspaper
critic, as far as we are aware, took notice of the production
in question. In the <i>Official Illustrated Catalogue</i> it is
entered simply as “Specimens to illustrate the rise and progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
of the art of making locks, containing forty-four different
movements by the most celebrated inventors in the lock trade.”
This trophy of lock ingenuity (for such it may be justly considered
to be) is now in the possession of Mr. Hobbs. Springing
from a hexagonal base-piece is a central axis, about three
feet in height, supporting four horizontal circular discs, placed
at different parts of its height. Each of the vertical faces of
the base-piece contains a lock, which is worked by its respective
key. Each disc contains a number of locks: 16 on the
lowest, 12 on the next above, 9 on the third in height, while a
Bramah lock surmounts the whole. All the locks on the discs
are so arranged that their bolts shoot outwards, or radially away
from the axis of the machine. Every lock has its own proper
key inserted in the key-hole; and as the locks lie down horizontally,
the shaft of each key is of course vertical. There are delicate
pieces of mechanism contained within the central axis and
within the discs, consisting of levers, racks, and pinions; and
the Bramah lock is contrived so ingeniously, that the Bramah
key, by acting upon that lock, acts upon all this mechanism.
The Bramah barrel, in rotating horizontally under the action of
its key, gives a rotary movement to a rod passing vertically
through the centre of the whole apparatus; this rod, at the levels
of the several discs, acts upon racks and pinions, and these in
turn act upon the key-pins of the several locks. When, therefore,
the Bramah key is turned, the whole of these key-pins
rotate, each exactly in the same way as if the lock were being
closed or opened, and the bolts shoot in or out accordingly.
The Bramah key, although it acts as a master-key, is not such
as usually obtains that designation; it is simply a means of
putting in action certain rack-and-pinion mechanism, which
does not belong to lock-work considered <i>per se</i>. All the locks
are faithful representatives of the several patents or modes of
construction to which they severally refer; and each exhibits
the works sufficiently open to display the principle on which
it is arranged. Each lock is numbered, and is referred to in
an accompanying description. The works are finished with<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
the utmost care and polish; and the trophy being somewhat
tastefully arranged, and kept under a glass shade, forms a really
elegant specimen of mechanical skill.</p>

<p>For an account of the locks themselves which constitute
this trophy, we cannot do better than avail ourselves of the
description given in the article “Lock” in Tomlinson’s <i>Cyclopædia
of Useful Arts</i>, adding a few further details in respect
to some of the locks of the series. The locks are arranged
and numbered according to their similarity of construction;
and it is instructive to remark the evidence here afforded,
that many patentees would have saved much time and money
if they had better known the productions of their predecessors.
In describing these locks we shall do so briefly, sufficient to
shew their relative principles of construction; many of them
having been described more or less fully in former chapters.</p>

<p>No. 1 on the list is called a <i>Roman lock</i>; it consists of a
single bolt, with a binder-spring for holding the bolt in any
position in which it may be placed until a sufficient force is
applied to overcome it: it embodies the simple principle on
which thousands of common locks are annually made.</p>

<p>No. 2, called a <i>French lock</i> (all such designations are of rather
doubtful correctness), resembling No. 1 in every thing except
having the addition of a friction-roller. The bolt of either of
these two locks can easily be forced back by pressing on the end.</p>

<p>No. 3 is marked <i>Ancient</i>; it is a bolt-lock, and was found
in an ancient building. It exhibits an improvement on both
the former specimens, in so far as the bolt requires, before it
can be shot, to be pressed down, in order to release it from a
catch at the back end of the bolt; this release cannot be
effected without the aid of a key or some other implement
applied through the key-hole, and thus the bolt answers the
purpose both of bolt and tumbler.</p>

<p>No. 4, also marked <i>Ancient</i>, is in principle a single-acting
tumbler-lock; that is, one in which the tumbler may fail to
be lifted high enough, but cannot be raised too high, to release
the bolt: whereas a double-acting tumbler, being susceptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
both of too much and too little ascent, must be raised to one
definite and precise height to attain the required object.</p>

<p>No. 5, an <i>old English lock</i>, exhibits a great advance in
principle, being provided with the double action just described
as being wanting in No. 4.</p>

<p>No. 6, <i>modern English</i> (no maker’s name), is a single-acting
tumbler-lock.</p>

<p>No. 7, by <i>Mace</i>, is a double-acting tumbler, but without
exhibiting any peculiarities of construction.</p>

<p>No. 8 is <i>Somerford’s first patent</i>. It is a double-acting <i>draw</i>
tumbler-lock; that is, there is a tumbler which is drawn down
instead of being lifted, as in most locks.</p>

<p>No. 9, designated, we know not on what grounds, an <i>Indian</i>
lock, has a single-acting tumbler with a pin.</p>

<p>No. 10, patented by Thompson in 1805. In this lock
there are two tumblers, one of which is single and the other
double-acting.</p>

<p>Next follow a considerable number of locks, which differ
one from another too slightly to render any formal description
necessary. No. 11, by <i>Daniells</i>, is a single-acting tumbler,
differing only in form from those previously used. No. 12 is
by <i>Walton</i>. No. 13 is <i>Barron’s</i> first patent, taken out in 1774.
No. 14 is by <i>Bickerton</i>. No. 15 is a <i>Dutch</i> lock. No. 16 is
by <i>Duce</i>, senior. No. 17, by <i>Sanders</i>, is a lock with four
double-acting tumblers. No. 18, patented by <i>Cornthwaite</i> in
1789, is so nearly like Sanders’s, brought before public notice
in 1839, as to corroborate what we have said concerning the
identity, or at least close resemblance, of inventions widely
asunder in point of time. No. 19 is by <i>Richards and Peers</i>.</p>

<p>No. 20 is <i>Somerford’s</i> second patent; a lock which seems
to embody the principle of Mr. Tann’s “reliance-wards,” patented
many years later. No. 21 is <i>Rowntree’s</i> lock, patented
in 1790. No. 22 is the first patent lock of <i>Duce</i>, junior, dated
1823. No. 23 is <i>Parsons’</i> first patent, of 1832. No. 24 is
<i>Bickerton’s</i> second. No. 25, patented by <i>Price</i> in 1774; this,
so far as at present appears, was the first lock ever constructed<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
with four double-acting tumblers, bearing a closer resemblance
than would generally be supposed to those patented by other
persons in more recent years. No. 26 exhibits a somewhat
similar coincidence. It was introduced by Aubin in 1830, and
is furnished with a <i>revolving curtain</i> for the purpose of closing
the key-hole during the revolution of the key. Other inventors
have since then adopted the revolving curtain; and in a
patent taken out so recently as 1852, this appendage is claimed
as part of the patent.</p>

<p>No. 27 is <i>Barron’s</i> second patent, dated 1778; a lock which
has perhaps been the model for a larger manufacture of plain
simple tumbler-locks than any other. No. 28 is by <i>Bird</i>, 1790.
No. 29 is the second patent of <i>Duce</i>, junior. No. 30 is
<i>Ruxton’s</i>, 1818. No. 31 is <i>Chubb’s</i> simplified lock, 1834.
No. 32 is by <i>Marr</i>. No. 33, by <i>Tann</i>, is the “reliance-ward”
lock adverted to above as having been anticipated, in respect
to its leading principle, by <i>Somerford’s</i> second patent. No. 34
is by <i>Hunter</i>, 1833. No. 35 is <i>Parsons’</i> second patent, of the
same year. No. 36 is by <i>Lang</i>, 1830. No. 37 is <i>Lawton’s</i>,
dated 1815. No. 38, patented by <i>Strutt</i> in 1839, has an
arrangement for holding the tumblers, in the event of a
pressure being applied to the bolt; an arrangement bearing
a considerable resemblance to one recently adopted in Chubb’s
bankers’ lock. No. 39 is by <i>Scott</i>, 1815. No. 40, <i>Chubb’s</i>
patent of 1818, is the original detector-lock of this maker.
Most of the detectors since patented by various persons are
little other than variations of Chubb’s original.</p>

<p>No. 41, <i>Parsons’</i> third patent of 1833, is a <i>changeable</i> lock
of peculiar construction. The elevation of the tumblers is
regulated by an adjusting-screw passing through the lock to
the inside of the door; this screw changes the positive but
not the relative positions of the tumblers; so that the same
difference in the steps of the key must be retained, the
change being made only in the length of the bit: the number
of changes for each lock is very limited.</p>

<p>No. 42, invented by <i>Pierce</i> in 1840, seems to be a carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
out of the plan suggested by the Marquis of Worcester in his
<i>Century of Inventions</i>, where he says that “a lock may be so
constructed that if a stranger attempteth to open it, it catches
his hand as a trap catcheth a fox; though far from maiming
him for life, yet marketh him so, that if once suspected he
might easily be detected.” In Pierce’s lock a steel barb or
sharp arrow-head is concealed below the key-hole, in such a
manner that if any person in attempting to open the lock
should over-lift the tumbler, the barb would be thrust by a
spring into his hand. It is said that the patentee himself
experienced the efficacy of this invention, by receiving the
barb into his own hand.</p>

<p>No. 43, by <i>Ruxton</i>, patented in 1816, is furnished with a
tell-tale, so arranged that if the tumbler be over-lifted in an
attempt to pick the lock, a pin or catch is thrown out from
the lock, which would be visible on opening the lock with
the proper key. This invention preceded Chubb’s detector
by two years, and would be entitled to some of the honours
of originality were not Chubb’s arrangement much more
simple and effective.</p>

<p>No. 44 is <i>Bramah’s</i>, the patent of 1784, and the crowning
lock of the trophy, by which all the others are opened. Similar
locks by <i>Russell</i> and <i>Mordan</i> are applications of the
Bramah principle, with little or no variation.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">No attempt has been made in these pages to describe every
variety of lock that has been introduced. Several forms of
puzzle locks, known as <i>Russian</i> and <i>Chinese locks</i>, have the
forms of various animals, and they are locked and unlocked
by pressing upon or moving some portion of the body of the
animal: the security of such locks depends in many cases
upon keeping the part to be pressed or moved secret. There
are also various forms of alarum locks; but these do not
greatly differ from common locks, except in having certain
appendages, such as a pistol, which if loaded and properly
adjusted, will be fired on any attempt being made to open<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
the lock, either with its own key or some other instrument.
Some locks are furnished with a bell or a rattle, which is
rung or sprung on attempting to open the lock, and in this
way the inmates of the house are informed of the attempt to
effect an entrance. It will, however, be evident to any one
who has read the preceding pages, that devices of this kind
do not add to the security of the lock; they rather tend to
degrade the art of the locksmith to that of the toyman. The
locksmith, in common with every other artist, can only improve
in his art by studying the principles upon which it
rests, and illustrating them by the most approved examples
which the constructive genius of his predecessors or contemporaries
has furnished.</p>

Engineers, 1866.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p class="noindent">The simple <i>fixed-guard</i> or <i>warded</i> lock is so utterly worthless
for security, no matter what amount of good workmanship be
bestowed upon it, that it demands but short notice. It was
contrived with the intention of making the passage to the
bolt intricate; but it will be seen at once that this intricacy
does not really offer any security. The wards of a lock are
circular arcs of thin metal, so arranged as to require a key of
peculiar pattern to pass amongst them, the shape of the cuts
in the key being a section of the wards. To make a really
complicated box of wards, and to cut keys which shall accurately
fit their sweep, is a matter requiring considerable
manual dexterity; and some warded locks are therefore expensive.
But even with the best of them, all that it is necessary
to do for opening the lock is to take a blank key which
will properly fit the keyhole, coat it with wax, and then inserting
it in the lock, press it round against the wards, which
will cause them to leave an accurate impression of their
section on the key. The parts impressed are then cut out
with small files, drills, and saws, and the occasional use of
fine cross-cut chisels. The key will then pass those wards
which impressed themselves upon it; and if these are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
only wards, it will go completely round and open the lock.
If there are also other wards in addition, not brought up
flush with the first wards, the key is waxed again and pressed
against them, and then further cut out, as before. This
process is evidently one of absolute certainty, and the key so
made is in all respects as capable of mastering the lock as
the original key.</p>

<p>These warded locks are however easily opened with merely
a piece of bent steel wire,&mdash;bent into such a sweep as will
reach right round the wards instead of passing amongst
them, thus escaping all chance of being obstructed by them.
Such an instrument is called by burglars a “twirl.”</p>

<p>The fixed-guard or warded lock was the one in general use
in the middle ages.</p>

<p>The next kind of lock is the <i>tumbler</i> lock, in which the
bolt is moved backwards and forwards by the key as usual,
but these movements cannot take place till a small lever with
a stump on one side be lifted. This lever and stump form
the tumbler, which is held down by a spring; and in the
tail of the bolt are two notches, into one of which the stump
fits when the bolt is shot, and into the other when it is withdrawn.
All that is necessary to effect the picking of this
lock is to lift the tumbler high enough for clearing the
stump out of the notch, and then draw back the bolt. The
tumbler may be lifted with one pick, and the bolt drawn
back with another; but generally one pick will suffice for
both purposes.</p>

<p>In the Barron tumbler lock the principle of double-action
was introduced.</p>

<p>The next improvement was the <i>lever</i> lock properly so called,
under which designation the majority of the modern locks
may be classed.</p>

<p>The Bramah lock was an admirable contrivance with remarkably
beautiful mechanism contained in a small compass;
and since its invention there have been several ingenious
modifications of the same principle in different radial locks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
such as the Yale lock, in which the slides move radially
instead of axially. One advantage in these radial locks is
the greater difficulty in copying the keys, in comparison with
the flat keys of ordinary lever locks: this difficulty however
is not an insurmountable one.</p>

<p>A very ingenious addition was made to the action of the
lever lock in Newell’s American lock, which was shown in
the 1851 Exhibition, and described at <a href="#Page89">page 89</a> of the present
volume.</p>

<p>Though locks such as those already referred to exhibit
great dissimilarity of construction, yet there is one point in
which they all agree, and that is in the possession of a direct
passage from the outside to the works. Although various
locks have been devised with the object of having no direct
passage to the works from the outside, one consideration
shows the inevitable existence of such a passage; namely,
that without it the key could not possibly at one and the
same time touch the hand of the operator and the works of
the lock. It therefore follows that any instrument which
can pass in the same space as the key may be brought to
bear on the works, whatever may be their construction.</p>

<p>It can now be shown that, if picking instruments are thus
brought to bear on the works through the keyhole, there is a
regular tentative system whereby the picking of any lock
with an open keyhole can sooner or later be effected.</p>

<p>From the foregoing observations it is evident that there
are two important defects in the principle of the previous
lever locks, which being defects in principle are fatal to their
security; namely, the means of access to the works of the
lock through the keyhole, allowing of a series of attempts
being made to open the lock by picking instruments; and
also the facility afforded for repeating the trial of a false key
made from a wax impression of the true key, and thus perfecting
it by successive alterations after trial. In consequence
of the possibility thus allowed of making these successive
attempts either by picking instruments or by a false<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
key, it has been shown by the cases that have occurred of
locks of the best makes which have been falsely opened, that,
however numerous and complicated may be the secondary
impediments introduced into these locks, there can be no real
security against the ultimate success of sufficiently numerous
and persevering attempts, except by the adoption of some new
principle of construction specially meeting the above two
defects.</p>

<p>In the invention of the Improved Lock and Key now to be
described, and which has been termed the <i>adytic</i>
lock,<a id="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the
writer’s object has been to meet this requirement. In <a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a>
is shown an elevation of this lock, such as is made for an iron
safe; two of the front cover plates being removed to show the
construction.</p>

<p>The head <span class="smcapall">B</span> of the main bolt is of such a thickness as to be
flush with the face of the levers <span class="smcapall">L</span> and guard
<span class="smcapall">A</span>; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span>
strap or tail <span class="smcapall">D</span> of the bolt is thin, and passes behind the levers
and guard, and also behind the plate <span class="smcapall">H H</span>. The part of the
tail <span class="smcapall">D</span> which would lie under the levers
<span class="smcapall">L</span> and cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> is
removed, as seen in <a href="#Fig54">fig. 54</a>, and replaced by a separate flat
plate or stump-bolt, carrying the stump <span class="smcapall">S</span>. This stump-bolt
has a projection <span class="smcapall">K</span> upon it, let into a recess in the tail <span class="smcapall">D</span>
of the main bolt, but with <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub>th inch vertical play in the recess.
A spring in the tail of the main bolt presses the stump-bolt
downwards, keeping the stump <span class="smcapall">S</span> in the notches of the
levers <span class="smcapall">L</span>, as shown in <a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a>. The stump-bolt can thus descend
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub>th inch at first without moving the main bolt, and this
amount of vertical movement is sufficient to carry the stump
in and out of the notches in the levers; but the stump-bolt
cannot descend further without taking the main bolt with it.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the bolts comes the fixed plate <span class="smcapall">H H</span>,
in which is cut the cam groove shown by the dotted line <span class="smcapall">J J</span>;
and also the vertical slot <span class="smcapall">E</span> for the pin <span class="smcapall">P</span> to work through,
together with another vertical slot in which the stump <span class="smcapall">S</span> fits
and works. This plate carries the centre pin <span class="smcapall">U</span> on which the
levers <span class="smcapall">L</span> turn. The levers are six in number, though any<span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span>
other number may be used; and they occupy collectively
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>ths inch thickness. In front of the plate <span class="smcapall">H</span> is fixed the
guard <span class="smcapall">A</span>, which is made of iron or steel,
and has the brass cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> ground into it.
The guard is made a shade thicker than
the levers <span class="smcapall">L</span>, in order to prevent the back
plate <span class="smcapall">H</span> and the corresponding front plate
from being so tightened on the levers as
to impede their freedom of movement. The
cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> is the same thickness as the
levers, excepting the centre boss <span class="smcapall">F</span>, which
projects from the back of the cylinder and
works in a bearing in the back plate <span class="smcapall">H</span>, and
also projects in front through the thickness
of the two front cover plates. The small
keyhole in the centre of the boss goes only
a short distance into the cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span>, being
merely for the purpose of enabling the
stem of the key <span class="smcapall">M</span>, <a href="#Fig55">fig. 55</a>, to turn the
cylinder; the bit of the key is a separate
piece, <span class="smcapall">N</span>, <a href="#Fig57">fig. 57</a>, which is inserted through
a separate keyhole into the radial slot of
the revolving cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span>, as shown at <span class="smcapall">N</span> in
<a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a>.</p>

<p>This radial slot is cut in the side of the cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> that is
furthest from the levers when the cylinder is in the position
shown in <a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a>; and in the slot fits the slide block <span class="smcapall">R</span>, which
is a steel block having a pin projecting on each side. The
back pin enters the guide groove <span class="smcapall">J J</span> in the back plate <span class="smcapall">H</span>, as
shown by the dotted line, and the front pin enters the corresponding
guide groove in the front cover plate, which is
shown removed. The back pin of the slide block projects
through the back plate <span class="smcapall">H</span>, as shown in <a href="#Fig56">fig. 56</a>, and works in
the cam groove <span class="smcapall">O</span> in the tail of the stump-bolt
<span class="smcapall">S</span>, <a href="#Fig54">fig. 54</a>, which
is so shaped that as the slide block travels round the guide
groove <span class="smcapall">J J</span>, shown by the dotted lines, it moves
the stump-bolt<span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span>
vertically as may be required according to the position of the
bolts and levers.</p>

<p>In the position of the lock shown in <a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a>, the bit <span class="smcapall">N</span> has
been inserted into the vacant space of the radial slot in the
cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span>, in front of the slide block <span class="smcapall">R</span>. The size of this
vacant space is <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>ths inch long by
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>th inch wide and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>ths
inch deep; and in the two front cover plates of the lock,
and also in the door to which the lock is attached, a hole
is made of the same shape. In the door there is no bearing
for the centre boss <span class="smcapall">F</span>, but only a small keyhole corresponding
in size with that in the boss <span class="smcapall">F</span> for inserting the stem of
the key.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig56">
<img src="images/illo179.png" alt="Adytic lock" />
<p class="caption">fig. 56.</p>
</div>

<p class="blankbefore75">In the position of the parts shown in <a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a>, it will be seen
that the levers <span class="smcapall">L</span> are held pressing down against the circumference
of the cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> by their springs <span class="smcapall">I</span> bearing against the
pin <span class="smcapall">P</span>. In this position also the bolt spring between the main
bolt and the stump-bolt, <a href="#Fig54">fig. 54</a>, presses the stump <span class="smcapall">S</span> down into
the notches of the levers, so that the levers are completely
locked by the stump, as seen in <a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a>.</p>

<p>In order to unlock the lock, which in <a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a> is shown with
the bolt shot, it is necessary that all the gatings <span class="smcapall">G</span> in the
levers should be brought precisely under the stump <span class="smcapall">S</span>.
Through the centre keyhole <span class="smcapall">F</span> there is no communication
possible at any time with the levers <span class="smcapall">L</span>; nor will any instrument,
however slender, if passed into the radial slot through
the aperture at <span class="smcapall">N</span> be able to reach them, whether the cylinder
<span class="smcapall">C</span> be in the position shown in
<a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a> or turned round into any<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
other position. For the only difference made by turning the
solid cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> is that the radial slot in it is carried away
from the aperture in the external plates, and the solid part of
the cylinder is brought opposite to the aperture, which is
thereby completely closed against the insertion of a picking
instrument. This construction accordingly not only precludes
the possibility of opening this lock with an ordinary key, in
which the part that acts on the levers is attached to the stem
of the key, but it also renders it an absolute impossibility to
introduce a pick of any form, as nothing can reach the levers
<span class="smcapall">L</span> except a detached piece of such a size and shape as to be
capable of travelling round in the vacant space left in front of
the slide block <span class="smcapall">R</span> in the radial slot of the cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span>.</p>

<div class="containerleft10m">

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig57">
<img src="images/illo180.png" alt="Lock bit" />
<p class="caption">fig. 57.</p>
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>For the purpose of unlocking the lock the bit <span class="smcapall">N</span>, <a href="#Fig57">fig. 57</a>, is
used. This bit is of such a size as to fit into the
vacant space of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> × <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
× <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch in the radial slot of
the cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span>; and the indent at <span class="smcapall">V</span> is merely for
the purpose of ensuring the insertion of the bit in
the right direction, the external aperture for the
bit being made with a corresponding projection
to fit the indent in the bit. This bit being inserted
through the aperture in the door, is pushed in by means
of the key stem <span class="smcapall">M</span>, which is flattened on two sides for that
purpose, as shown in <a href="#Fig55">fig. 55</a>; and the bit is thus pushed
home into its place in the radial slot of the cylinder, as
shown at <span class="smcapall">N</span>, <a href="#Fig53">fig. 53</a>.</p>

<p>The key stem <span class="smcapall">M</span> is now inserted into the centre keyhole <span class="smcapall">F</span>,
and the cylinder is turned round by it in the direction shown
by the arrow, carrying round the slide block <span class="smcapall">R</span> and the bit <span class="smcapall">N</span>.
The slide block <span class="smcapall">R</span>, while moving through the concentric portion
at the commencement of the guide grooves <span class="smcapall">J J</span>, does not affect
the bit; but by means of the cam groove <span class="smcapall">O</span> in the tail of the
stump-bolt, <a href="#Fig54">fig. 54</a>, it moves that bolt so far as to lift the stump
<span class="smcapall">S</span> completely out of the notches in the levers <span class="smcapall">L</span>, which are
thereby left free to be raised. On continuing to turn the
cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span>, the eccentric part of the guide grooves
<span class="smcapall">J J</span> causes<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
the slide block <span class="smcapall">R</span> to move outwards along the radial slot,
pushing the bit <span class="smcapall">N</span> before it; and the bit is thus made to project
beyond the circumference of the cylinder, which it can
then do, being no longer confined by the guard <span class="smcapall">A</span>. The further
projection of the bit as the cylinder revolves causes the steps
in the bit to lift their respective levers; and the steps in the
bit are so arranged that, when the cylinder arrives at the
position shown in <a href="#Fig58">fig. 58</a>, all the gatings <span class="smcapall">G</span> are brought simultaneously
opposite the stump <span class="smcapall">S</span>, which is instantly shot down
through the distance of the <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub>th inch play by the bolt spring.
The bit <span class="smcapall">N</span> remains in contact with the extreme part <span class="smcapall">T</span> of the
levers while the stump <span class="smcapall">S</span> is entering the gatings, the action of
the bolt spring being so rapid that the bit cannot move
through any appreciable distance during the time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig58">
<img src="images/illo181.png" alt="Adytic lock" />
<p class="caption">fig. 58.</p>
</div>

<p>In other locks a spring action of this kind would greatly
facilitate the picking, inasmuch as it would afford the gentle
uniform pressure desired upon the levers. In other locks,
therefore, the bolt is caused to move, and the stump to<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
enter the gatings, by the direct contact of the key with
the bolt, instead of by a spring; but as the key, while
moving the stump into the gatings, is also altering its
position under the levers, a slight tremulous motion of the
levers is thereby occasioned, which no care in manufacture
can obviate. This tremulous motion is aggravated by the
circumstance that, as the keyhole is open to inspection, it is
necessary to make all the levers fit flush with one another when
down, in order to avoid affording any clue to the shape of the
key from the positions of the levers; but as the various steps
of the key, being of different lengths, describe different arcs,
the curves of the levers when raised are of necessity in error
to them all. The result of these combined faults is that the
gatings have to be made wider than the stump, to allow a
sufficient amount of play, thus introducing a fatal element of
insecurity in the construction of the lock, since the security
is of course enhanced in proportion as the gatings fit the
stump accurately. In the new lock, on the contrary, the arc
<span class="smcapall">T</span>, <a href="#Fig58">fig. 58</a>, in each lever, can be shaped truly to its own proper
radius, independent of all the rest of the levers; and as the
action of the stump is instantaneous in catching the gatings
as soon as they are all brought simultaneously under it, the
stump and gatings can be made to fit one another with the
most perfect accuracy, and without the slightest play.</p>

<p>On turning the cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> further round, the bit <span class="smcapall">N</span> passes
from under the levers, which remain held back by the insertion
of the stump in the gatings; and just before reaching
the position shown in <a href="#Fig59">fig. 59</a>, the slide block <span class="smcapall">R</span> has pushed
the bit completely out of the radial slot, and the bit falls
down as shown in <a href="#Fig59">fig. 59</a>, and drops through a hole into the
inside of the safe that is locked. At this point the back pin
of the slide block comes in contact with the lower side of the
cam groove <span class="smcapall">O</span> in the stump-bolt, <a href="#Fig54">fig. 54</a>; and by turning the
cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> onwards to the position shown in <a href="#Fig60">fig. 60</a>, the withdrawal
of the bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span> is completed, bringing the parts into the
position shown in <a href="#Fig60">fig. 60</a>. In these drawings only one lever<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
<span class="smcapall">L</span> is shown; but there are altogether six levers, as shown in
the sectional plan, <a href="#Fig56">fig. 56</a>. The pin <span class="smcapall">P</span> is fixed in the tail <span class="smcapall">D</span> of
the main bolt, so as to travel with the bolt; and by this
means the springs <span class="smcapall">I</span> are released from strain, as shown in
<a href="#Fig60">fig. 60</a>, as soon as the bolt is withdrawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig59">
<img src="images/illo183.png" alt="Adytic lock" />
<p class="caption">fig. 59.</p>
</div>

<p class="blankbefore75">From the nicety with which the various parts of this lock
are constructed, it is evident that the levers must be very
accurately lifted by the bit of the key in order to withdraw
the bolt; and therefore any error in the bit, such as would
occur with a false bit, will effectually prevent the lock from
being opened. This may be illustrated by supposing the
false bit to be so close an imitation as to have five of its steps
absolutely correct, and the sixth only slightly wrong: though
it is almost impossible that such a near approach to correctness
could be attained in practice. The counterfeit bit being
inserted in the lock, and the cylinder turned round, all will
go on the same as with the true bit, up to the time when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
false bit reaches the point <span class="smcapall">T</span> of the levers, as previously shown
with the true bit in <a href="#Fig58">fig. 58</a>. Here a change of action takes
place; but what is the nature of the change the operator has
no means as yet of ascertaining. In the case supposed, where
five of the steps in the bit are right, but the sixth is wrong, the
gating of the sixth lever does not precisely coincide with the
others, nor with the stump <span class="smcapall">S</span>; and the consequence is that, at
the critical moment when the stump ought to spring into the
gatings and hold back the levers from falling forwards, it will
be prevented from entering the gatings, owing to the entrance
being partly blocked up by the one lever, which stands more
or less across it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig60">
<img src="images/illo184.png" alt="Adytic lock" />
<p class="caption">fig. 60.</p>
</div>

<p>The fact, however, that the stump cannot enter the gatings,
does not become known to the operator until the cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span>
has been turned further round, so as to bring the slide-block
pin in contact with the lower side of the cam groove <span class="smcapall">O</span> in the
stump-bolt; and before this point has been reached the false
bit has already passed clear of the levers, which, not being
retained by the stump, are instantly thrown forwards again
by their springs, and locked in their original position by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
stump entering the notches. At the same time the false bit
has dropped into the inside of the safe in the same manner as
the true bit, as shown in <a href="#Fig61">fig. 61</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig61">
<img src="images/illo185.png" alt="Adytic lock" />
<p class="caption">fig. 61.</p>
</div>

<p>Hence a person putting a false bit into one of these locks
will not only infallibly lose it at the very first trial, but will
do so without gaining any information as to the nature of its
inaccuracy; for as the gatings of the levers cannot be seen or
felt, all that can be told about the action of a false bit is,
that it has failed to open the lock. In fact, a counterfeit bit
passes under the levers, and through the lock, just like the
true bit; and it is only the stoppage afterwards met with of
the bolt that indicates the failure of the false bit, which is
by that time gone beyond recovery. Whatever amount of
labour, therefore, may have been spent on the fabrication of a
counterfeit bit, this bit can only be tried once, so that no
alteration can afterwards be made in it.</p>

<p>Nothing that can be inserted into the radial slot of the
cylinder <span class="smcapall">C</span> through the aperture in the front plates can do
any injury to the lock; and a charge of gunpowder inserted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
that way would only blow out again at the orifice without
damaging the lock, both the apertures for the key being
merely blind holes with parallel sides.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">For the manufacture of the
bits for the keys of this lock
a self-acting machine is employed,
in which the height
and width of the several steps
in the bit are regulated by
adjustments of very great accuracy,
and admitting of an
almost endless variety of figure
for the bits. This key-cutting
machine is shown in
<a href="#Fig62">figs. 62</a> to <a href="#Fig63">64</a>, and consists
of a small circular saw <span class="smcapall">A</span> running vertically, of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
thickness as each step in the bit <span class="smcapall">I</span>, which is brought up
to the saw by the slide-rest <span class="smcapall">B</span>. The bit <span class="smcapall">I</span> is fixed in the
holder <span class="smcapall">C</span>, which rocks upon a centre, so as to give the required
curvature to the edge of each step in the bit when cut by<span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span>
the saw, as shown in the full-size section of the bit-holder,
<a href="#Fig63">fig. 63</a>. The adjustment of the depth of cut is effected by the
set screw <span class="smcapall">D</span> upon the slide-rest coming up against the eccentric
ring <span class="smcapall">E</span> upon the bed of the slide-rest; this ring is turned
round by hand, and set to sixteen different positions by means
of the catch-pin <span class="smcapall">F</span> and the sixteen holes on the circumference
of the ring, allowing of sixteen different depths of cut. The
lateral adjustment for the pitch between the successive steps
of the bit is effected by the two bed-screws <span class="smcapall">G G</span> acting on the
slide-rest <span class="smcapall">B</span>, having a dividing plate on the head, and such a
pitch of thread that one turn of the screws traverses the slide-rest
through the exact distance of one step in the bit. The
occurrence of any play or backlash is entirely prevented by
having the screws placed one at each end of the slide-rest; so
that by slacking back one screw through one or more turns,
and then advancing the other through the same number of
turns, the slide-rest is always held with perfect steadiness
between them, filling exactly the space between the ends of
the two screws.</p>

<p>The number of changes admissible in this key-cutting
machine, if used for making keys for locks having six levers,
is the number of permutations that sixteen terms are capable
of when taken six together, which is upwards of sixteen
millions. Some of these changes are so slight that too great
accuracy of workmanship would be required to make the
locks accordingly; but of those changes that differ from one
another so far that no lock could be opened by any other than
its own key, more remain than could be used up by all the
locks in the world.</p>

</div>

<p>The writer may observe that it was the study of the circumstances
of the great gold robbery on the 15th of May,
1855, by Agar and his confederates (when two of the best
lever locks were picked, and gold stolen weighing upwards
of 200 lbs., while in transit on the South-Eastern Railway
from London to Paris, packed in three sealed iron-bound
boxes, inclosed in a bullion safe, secured by those locks),<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
and of the various modes of picking locks, which led him to
turn his attention to the achievement of what had been so
long and perseveringly sought after, namely, an unpickable
lock. The principle of a detached bit has been previously
tried, in so far as that locks have been made in which the bit of
the key was deposited in the lock by unscrewing the key stem,
and then withdrawn by screwing in the stem again. But
inasmuch as the detached bit, even though it failed to open
the lock in the case of a counterfeit key, could always be
brought back again to the keyhole and removed, this admitted
of a repetition of attempts with successive alterations of the
one counterfeit key, without the certainty that any warning
would be given by the lock of such attempts having been
made.</p>

<p>In another still more complicated lock with a detached bit
there were two keyholes, into one of which the bit of the key
was put, and the stem being then unscrewed from the bit,
was put into the second keyhole and turned round so as to close
the first keyhole over the bit; a separate handle was then
turned to work the lock, six separate operations being required
for either opening or closing the lock. Further, a
kind of retainer has been attempted by so arranging the lock
that, if any key was put in but the right one, it was held in
the keyhole in such a manner that it could never be got out.
In this case, however, if the false key would not open the
lock, neither would it let even the right one do so, and it
would be necessary to break open the door secured by the
lock.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">In the new lock here described, the special points that have
been aimed at are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly, in no position of the lock is there any access to the
works from the outside through the keyhole. This access
through the keyhole is more or less a defect in all other principles
of lock, as it admits of feeling and manipulating the
works for the purpose of getting information for picking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
lock in the absence of the right key; whereas in the new
lock there is no opening whatever at any time, except the
two plain parallel recesses into which the key and the bit are
fitted. From the moment the turning of the lock commences
both these recesses are effectually blocked up: the one for the
bit being conveyed bodily away from the keyhole, and its
place taken by the solid metal of the cylinder; while the
other is completely filled by the key, which cannot be withdrawn
except by turning it back to the original position. In
consequence of this construction no injury can be done to the
lock by explosion of gunpowder in the keyhole, the only
openings from the outside being parallel at their sides, and
not communicating with any portion of the interior of the
lock; and the simplicity and solidity of construction are such
that the revolving cylinder is made practically air-tight within
its bearing. This effectually prevents all attempts to open
the lock by picklocks, and leaves no alternative but the
attempt to make a sufficiently accurate copy of the true key.</p>

<p>Secondly, as no clue whatever can be obtained from the
outside of the lock respecting the key required, the attempts
upon the lock are thus limited to the chance of obtaining a
wax impression of the true key. The difficulty of making a
counterfeit key sufficiently correct by this means for opening
one of the best of the previous constructions of lock is very
great; but in the new lock this difficulty is greatly increased
by the fact of the levers remaining absolutely stationary while
the stump enters the gatings, in consequence of which the
gatings are made so close a fit to the stump that an exceedingly
minute error in the lifting of any of the levers is sufficient
to prevent the lock being opened. This extreme
delicacy of construction can be carried out practically without
objection in the new lock, because there is no possibility of
putting a strain from the key upon the stump, so as to cause
injury by forcing it at the moment of entering the gatings;
for the only force acting upon the stump at that time is
the uniform pressure of its own spring. In addition to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
source of increased safety, there is the still more important
circumstance that only a single trial can be made of each
counterfeit bit; because, if carried forwards far enough to
try its effect in opening the lock by passing the levers, the
bit is inevitably lost by falling through the lock and inside
the door. Thus not only is all chance prevented of a second
trial with the same key, but the bit retained inside the door
gives warning of the attempt having been made, and shows
how near the counterfeit key has approached to the original.
The numerous cases that have occurred of attempts to open
locks by counterfeit keys, such as the remarkable instance
previously referred to, show that even with the most practised
hands it is next to impossible to make from a wax impression
a key that will serve for opening a good lock the very first
time it is tried; and the striking importance is therefore seen
of this arrangement in the new lock, which prevents more
than a single attempt being made with a counterfeit.</p>

<p>Thirdly, another advantage to be named in this lock is that
the stem alone of the key is required to lock it, but it can
only be unlocked by the complete key. The stem, therefore,
can be left by the principal of an establishment for locking up
by a subordinate; but the bit, which is the essential part of the
key required for opening the lock, need never be used or seen
by any one but the principal himself. As the hole in the
external door-plate for the stem of the key has a notch on
one side only to admit the key stem, and the cylinder is prevented
from making a complete revolution, the stem of the
key cannot be withdrawn from the lock except when the bolt
is shot; so that its absence from the keyhole serves as a proof
that the bolt is shot.</p>

<p>Fourthly, one other advantage in this lock is its simplicity
and solidity of construction. It contains no more parts than
the simpler forms of lever lock having the same number of
levers, and the total number of separate pieces in the complete
lock is only sixteen. The principle of security, therefore,
upon which the new lock is constructed, avoids entirely the<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
complications and the delicate and minute class of work rendered
necessary in other locks by the use of detectors and the
other auxiliary contrivances employed for increasing the difficulty
of picking.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Fenby exhibited, at a <i>conversazione</i> of the Institute of
Civil Engineers, and at the meeting of Mechanical Engineers,
specimens of his adytic lock, and showed its action both with
the true key and with counterfeit keys; and he showed by
trial that the counterfeit failed to open the lock, notwithstanding
that by means of the permutating cutting machine
it had been made a much nearer approach to a perfect copy
than was practicable in the best handwork from a wax impression.
He also exhibited the key-cutting machine employed for
cutting the bits; and also a set of burglar’s tools employed
for drilling into the door of an iron safe sufficiently for
breaking open or removing the lock, showing that the hold
required for giving the cutting pressure upon the powerful
drill employed for the purpose was obtained by a steel cross
piece inserted into the keyhole and turned at right angles, so
as to hold across inside the lock; but in the new lock, as the
keyhole had no opening into the lock, and only a slight
shoulder on one side, no means were afforded for obtaining
the required hold for the drill.</p>

<p>The following are the salient points of the discussion that
followed the reading of his paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Chairman remarked that the paper just read gave a
very excellent and clear description of the detailed working
of the new lock, and he thought this construction of lock was
a most valuable one, as affording real security against all
fraudulent attempts. He inquired whether there would be
any possibility of tampering with the lock by examining it
upon the inside of a safe door, whenever the door might
happen to be left unlocked.</p>

<p>Mr. Fenby replied that there was no means of tampering<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
with the lock from the inside of the door, as the two keyholes
for working the lock were only in the front face of the door,
and the lock was all closed up on the inside of the door,
excepting the hole through which the bit was allowed to drop
out; but this would be useless for the purpose of tampering
with the lock, as the bit dropped down a tube leading to the
bottom of the door, through which no examination of the lock
could be successfully made.</p>

<p>The Chairman inquired whether there was any provision
against the bit being accidentally locked up inside the safe,
in which case it appeared the lock could not be opened again.</p>

<p>Mr. Fenby replied that the owner of the safe must of course
be careful after unlocking the safe to take the bit out before
locking it again, otherwise there would be no means of opening
the lock afterwards with that key. As a precaution,
however, against any such accident, each lock was provided
with three bits, all duplicates, one of which would be kept
in the pocket for use, while the two others would be preserved
in a place of safety for the chance of any such contingency.
Moreover, in most of the safes fitted with these
locks, the tube through which the bit dropped had been made
of such a length as to carry out the bit on opening the door,
dropping it into a small tin tray outside the safe; and by this
means the accidental locking in of the right bit was rendered
impossible. One of the advantages of the new lock was that
the stem of the key was not required to be kept constantly in
the possession of the owner, but it might be left in the
lock, as the bit alone was the valuable part of the key; and
as the bits were of such small size and convenient shape, a
number of them might readily be kept in the pocket by a person
having charge of a number of safes, without the inconvenience
attending a large bunch of ordinary keys. In the
case of an attempt being made to open the lock with a counterfeit
bit, the advantages of retaining the counterfeit inside the
safe were not merely that the person attempting the lock was
deprived of his instrument, while the proprietor immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
discovered the attempt upon the next occasion of
opening the safe; but the retention of the counterfeit itself
afforded the means of judging, by a comparison with the true
bit, whether the attempt had been made altogether in the
dark as to the actual construction of the lock, or whether it
was likely that some clue regarding the true bit had been
obtained by means of a wax impression or otherwise. In the
latter case the owner of the safe might think it desirable to
have the lock taken off, and the arrangement of the levers altered,
and a new bit made so as to baffle any further attempts.</p>

<p>Mr. W. S. Longridge observed that the inconvenience that
had been alluded to with the new lock, of accidentally locking
up the bit inside the safe, was no greater than occurred with
an ordinary safe lock if ever the key was accidentally lost;
in either case, unless the precaution was taken of keeping a
duplicate in reserve, it would of course be necessary to have
the safe broken open.</p>

<p>The Chairman inquired how the ideas had been arrived at
of separating the bit from the key, and of preventing all access
to the works through the keyhole, and also of retaining the
bit inside the door after any attempt at unlocking.</p>

<p>Mr. Fenby replied that his attention had in the first
instance been attracted to the subject of the picking of locks as
a mechanical problem, and he had found that there had hitherto
been no principle in lockmaking which could effectually
baffle persevering attempts at picking. For although there
were certain complicated constructions of locks, having many
points of excellence, they had all yielded in time to the picking
instrument in clever hands; and it must be remembered
that any individual lock when once constructed remained
stationary as regarded subsequent improvement, whereas the
art of picking that lock was continually progressing towards
success, with all previous constructions of locks, and it was
clear therefore that the lock must ultimately be defeated.
He had been further stimulated in the investigation of this
subject by the occurrence of the great gold robbery referred<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
to at page 188; and the circumstance which had struck him
most forcibly in connection with that robbery had been that
locks of the best make hitherto known had admitted of seven
successive trials being made upon them without detection,
each trial furnishing the information for further perfecting
the counterfeit key, until the locks were at length opened.</p>

<p>These considerations had led him to the conclusion that two
points were established and were required to be kept in view
for the construction of any lock that should be really secure
against fraudulent attempts. The first point was that wherever
a man could get instruments into the lock he could ultimately
solve any problem laid before him by the maker of the lock, as
the lock when once made could be tried any number of times
if an instrument could be got into it at all. Hence he had
concluded that it was requisite for all access to the interior to
be cut off, so as to preclude all possibility of getting a pick-lock
in; and this was accordingly accomplished by adopting
the plan of separating the bit from the stem of the key. The
second point established was that it was necessary to prevent
the possibility of making a succession of trials with the same
counterfeit key; and it had then struck him that, if the bit of
the key were arranged to drop inside the safe in unlocking,
there would be no means of going on gradually improving
and touching up the counterfeit from the results of previous
trials, as the false bit would be irrecoverably lost in the very
first attempt, without furnishing any clue whatever as a guide
for alteration in a subsequent trial. The first lock that he
had invented for meeting the requirements thus pointed out
had been made with a solid block having a tunnel through it,
but involving the same principle of retaining the bit of the
key and keeping the levers inaccessible from the outside.
Subsequently, however, he had abandoned that construction
and produced the new lock shown in the drawings, having
the revolving barrel with radial slot.</p>

<p>The Chairman proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Fenby for
his paper, which was passed.</p>

<h3><span class="h3nr">CHAPTER XIV.</span><br />
<span class="h3name">FENBY’S PATENT STOP-LOCK.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">This lock has been designed with a view to doing away
with several weak points in the construction of lever locks.</p>

<p>The introduction of the movable stump by Mr. Hobbs, in
order to defeat picking by the tentative method of applying
pressure to the bolt, so as to cause binding between the stump
and the levers, was a great advance in the art of lock-making.</p>

<p>The movable stump, as so constructed, was, however, open
to this objection, that while sufficiently delicate and certain
in its action to render picking very difficult, it was at the
same time, through the smallness of its parts&mdash;resulting from
the confined space available for its action&mdash;unsuited to withstand
any amount of force applied to push back the bolt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig65">
<img src="images/illo196.png" alt="Stop-lock" />
<p class="caption">fig. 65.</p>
</div>

<p>In the lock under notice the stump <i>s</i> is formed in the solid
on the shorter arm <i>a</i><sup>1</sup> of a cranked lever or oscillating stop
<i>a</i>. This stop <i>a</i> works on the steel pin or centre <i>b</i>, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
latter has a bearing in both plates of the lock. At the end <i>a</i>
of the stop <i>a</i> is a recess formed to fit the corner <i>d</i> of the bolt-head.
<i>c</i> is a stud limiting the range of <i>a</i> in an upward
direction, so that when in its normal position the stop <i>a</i> may
just clear the bolt-head, as shown in <a href="#Fig65">figs. 65</a>, <a href="#Fig66">66</a>, and <a href="#Fig67">67</a>. The
tail of the bolt, instead of being in the form usually adopted,
is formed of the bar <i>e</i> set on edge so as to reach from the back
to the front plate of the lock, completely dividing the lower
part, in which the keyhole lies, from the upper, in which the
main parts of the works are placed.</p>

<p>This bar <i>e</i> works between the guide pieces <i>g g</i>, so that in
whatever position the bolt may be, the division of the lock
into two chambers is complete. At <i>f</i> is the recess in which
the key acts to move the bolt. The levers <i>l</i> turn upon the
pin <i>i</i> formed in the solid of the bolt-head. The part of each
lever on which the key is to act passes through a slot or
recess in <i>e</i>, the parts <i>h</i> and <i>h</i><sup>1</sup> of the levers being struck to
the arcs of circles, having their centres coincident with that
upon which the levers turn at <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>As it is not possible to lift the levers out of this slot in the
bar <i>e</i>, and further, as the levers and bolt move together in a
longitudinal direction, the movements necessary to locking
and unlocking open no communication between the upper and
lower chambers of the lock.</p>

<p>The springs of the levers are formed out of the solid metal
of the levers themselves, and are thus not liable to that displacement
which so often occurs with separate springs, nor
to the corrosion by oxidation incidental to steel springs.
They are cut round the corner, and down the front of the
lever, to gain greater elasticity.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig65">fig. 65</a> the lock is shown with the front plate removed,
and the works as they stand when unlocked. <a href="#Fig66">Fig. 66</a> is the
same, except that the works are shown locked, and the back
plate removed instead of the front. <a href="#Fig67">Fig. 67</a> shows the <i>front</i>
view of <a href="#Fig66">fig. 66</a>. <a href="#Fig68">Fig. 68</a> shows the result of any attempt to
pick the lock by pressure.</p>

<p class="caption">fig. 68.</p>
</div>

<p>The lock being locked, as shown in figs. 66 and 67, it will
be seen that the stop <i>a</i> just clears the angle <i>d</i> of the bolt-head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
Further, that the gatings <i>r</i> of the levers <i>l</i> cannot pass the
stump <i>s</i>, unless the levers be so lifted as to coincide with each
other and the stump. The stop <i>a</i> being held up by a very
light pressure from the lever springs, a small force applied to
the stump <i>s</i> is sufficient to upset its equilibrium, and bring
down its end <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> upon the bolt-head at <i>d</i>, as shown in <a href="#Fig68">fig. 68</a>.
This occurs whenever an attempt is made to “<i>feel</i>” the stump
with the levers; and not only does the stop <i>a</i> free the levers
from all pressure, and so preserve them and the stump from
injury, and the lock from being picked, but it also forms a
strut for securing the bolt: in fact, no violence short of that
necessary to shear the pin <i>b</i> can make the bolt yield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span></p>

<p>The drawings show a mortise lock, but the improvements
shown are universally applicable in the construction of locks
of all kinds.</p>

<p>For the manufacture of these and other locks, and kindred
articles, Messrs. J. B. Fenby and Co., engineers of the Liverpool
Works, Birmingham, have put up, from the designs of
their managing partner, Mr. J. Beverley Fenby, an experimental
set of machinery, almost entirely self-acting, and
calculated to turn out large quantities of the component parts
of locks and other articles with extreme accuracy and
rapidity.</p>

<p>The whole set works on the interchangeable system&mdash;as
already in use for military small arms. It is not,
however, to be supposed that, because the parts of the
locks are interchangeable, one key will open several locks&mdash;such
a source of insecurity being guarded against by the
permutating key-cutting machines invented by Mr. Fenby.
These machines give complete command over the making
of keys, whether it be required to make a comparatively
unlimited number, all differing from each other, to make
a number alike, or to make sets with master keys.</p>

<p>Atmospheric and hydraulic pressure also plays an important
part in shaping many of the parts of the locks.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span></p>

<h3>NOTE UPON IRON SAFES.</h3>

<p>At the conclusion of this work upon locks it will not be out
of place to make a few remarks upon the degree of real safety
that attaches to what are commonly called “safes,” and to
point out in a common-sense way what are the chief dangers
that these may incur from depredators (whether burglars or
in times of public anarchy and violence), and what are the
main conditions to be relied upon for safety&mdash;assuming that, by
one or other of the constructions pointed out in the preceding
pages, the <i>lock</i> of the safe be such as to be practically unpickable,
and that carelessness shall not have placed the true key
in the possession of the thief.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt upon the mind of any mechanic or
engineer, thoroughly acquainted with practical working in
metals, that a good deal of what has been brought forward
and affirmed, both by safe-makers and by burglars themselves
(turned approvers), as to the wonderfully-ingenious devices
resorted to by the latter, by which, if we were to believe
it all, nothing in the shape of steel or iron can possibly withstand
ultimately the redoubtable powers of these people, is
simply fiction&mdash;imaginary ingenuity utterly impracticable if
tried. Such, for example, is the notion of its being possible,
by an ounce or two of gunpowder exploded in the interior, to
so blow asunder and dislocate the parts of a well-made safe-lock
that the bolts shall then be easily got loose, or that a
steel-plated safe which resists the drill can be softened “by
the blowpipe.” And just as absurd are some of the wonderful
pieces of ingenuity by which some of the burglars’ actual
devices are supposed to be met and frustrated; as, for example,
one for which we believe a patent has been obtained, consisting
in filling-in the hollow space between the inside and outside
plates of the safe with cast-iron bullets left loose. These
might, no doubt, break a <i>flat</i>-stemmed drill, after that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
pierced the outer plate, but could have no effect whatever
upon a <i>round</i>-shanked drill, such as one of the ordinary American
spiral, or <i>teredo</i>-pointed drills.</p>

<p>That there are some methods of violence still untried, and
yet at the command of the burglar who dares to risk a tolerably
loud noise of explosive agents, is well known to skilful
mechanical engineers, and for obvious reasons it would be
unwise that we should give any information as to such; but the
real practical and too-often effectual methods of the burglar
limit themselves almost entirely to the use of the succession
of steel wedges, followed by the powerful steel-pointed pinching
bar, or bars, to the forcing or prizing-screw, and to making
more or less way for this by cutting out beforehand by the
pin-drill.</p>

<p>A safe, to be safe, must be so circumstanced or so constructed,
or both, that it should be able to resist the best efforts
that can be made by these methods for several hours; perhaps
we might say as much as thirty to thirty-six hours&mdash;viz.,
from Saturday night to Monday morning.</p>

<p>Now we hesitate not to say that the unsafeness of “safes”
arises not from any structural difficulty whatever, but almost
always from the parsimony and ignorance of those who purchase
and employ them. Safes, like razors, are made to sell,
and if the public demand is for cheap safes, such as we see
every day advertised in the newspapers, it was sure to have
been, and is, met by a supply of things called safes which are
utterly unsafe. The great mass of the showy green and gold
gewgaws that one sees in the safe-shop windows, with flaming
testimonials as to their fire and burglar-proof powers, are
simple shams: a genuine safe could not be made at their
prices.</p>

<p>The very first condition to constitute a genuine safe is that
it shall have an ample mass of metal&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, not of cast-iron,
but of wrought-iron, or best of steel, all round it; and especially
that the margins of metal all round the door shall be
of such huge and surplus scantling that no amount of wedging,<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
by construction possible, should be able to bend any one
side sensibly. The next is that the workmanship of every part
of the safe be first-class: not that there be merely a moulded
door with a showy lock and a trumpery brass-plate upon it,
but that every corner and joint of plate with plate in sides
and back be effectually united and jointed in the best manner,
and that the fitting of the hardened edges of the door shall be
like those of a valve, and not even let a watch-spring be got
in between. If these obvious conditions be observed, and that
the safe itself be properly posited in the premises, it will be
found, even with ordinary forms of construction as to doors
and bolts, but with a really unpickable lock, a very hard nut
for the best burglar to crack.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo203.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Chatwood’s Safes.</p>
</div>

<p>But much more may be effected without any serious increase
of cost. Several forms of safes are now made, the
rabbets of the doors of which are so formed that it is almost
a physical impossibility to get any wedge, however thin, to
drive in between the door and the frame. This is effected in
Chatwood’s patent safes (of Bolton and Manchester), as figured
above, by making the door rabbets in cross section <i>curvilinear</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
so that even if the fit be not so perfect but that the edges of
a very thin wedge can still be inserted, it yet cannot be
driven&mdash;for, as it goes forward, it must become curved, and
if soft, so as thus to bend, the thin steel will not bear the
severe strain of driving, but if hard, it breaks off into short
bits close to the entrance. In addition to this Chatwood’s
(and we believe other makers’) safes have bolts so constructed,
as seen in the figure, that they <i>hook</i> or lock into the bolt
recesses in the frame in such a manner as to hold the opposite
sides of the frame together, so that, independent of its own
proper stiffness, it cannot be bent anywhere, unless by tearing
asunder the end on the iron bar constituting each cross-bolt.
The bolts, in fact, not only secure the door (as in ordinary)
from opening, but secure the door and frame together. With
such a safe, if the owner will only provide a proper position
for it in his premises, he may rest pretty easy in mind.</p>

<p>Safes are very commonly stood upon a wooden floor, or made
to form part of a wood-framed bookcase, or press, or stand in
a recess. Often they are comeatable all round, and even
underneath, with nought but an inch board below them, and
almost always they are left with the front door freely and fully
exposed, and with ample and convenient room left all round.
This for two or three workmen to manipulate the safe as they
may.</p>

<p>Now the only real conditions of safety are that the iron safe
should be bedded into brickwork set in Portland cement and
sand; or, what is much better, in hard granite or gritstone
masonry, bedded in like manner. Without this be done, a
fire-proof safe is simply a delusion; constructed how it may be,
it is only a crucible of more or less badly-conducting power,
in which, after a time longer or shorter, deeds, bank-notes,
documents, &amp;c., will be calcined, and coin or jewellery
melted, and gems flawed and destroyed. We say this in the
full face of the delusive so-called “fiery ordeals” to which
many of the so-called double-cased fire-proof safes are alleged
to have been for hours exposed. The safe should always be<span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span>
embedded in masonry, and rest upon that in such a way that
it cannot get undermined by either fire or burglars.</p>

<p>Whenever the premises admit of it, the door of the
safe itself should be set back 10 or 12 inches from the face of
the wall in which it is embedded, and an outer door, flush
with the face of the wall, should be provided of iron, with a
good lock and multiple bolts. The door of the safe should
open to the right; and if so, the outer door should open to
the left; and neither should open more than square to their
position when shut. No one but a practical workman or
engineer can have an adequate notion of the extent to
which any mechanical operation upon the door of a safe thus
circumstanced is hampered by its being set back into the
wall, and with an outer door that even when open, cuts off
all ready manual access to the inner door from one side.</p>

<p>When premises are constructed, as they should be for all
banks and bullion merchants, jewellers, &amp;c., having special
regard to a safe as an indisputably secure depository, then
the safe should be completely iron or steel cased, and embedded
in hard stone masonry (we shall not here go into
additional special precautions against the remoter effects of
fire), covered in with a strong fire-brick arch, and with
nothing but the solid ground below. The door of the safe
should only be approachable through an iron or stone-lined
passage, just the size of the safe-door, and no more. This
should be some feet in length, and have an outer double-cased
steel door, or perhaps that and an intermediate iron
falling-door or portcullis, between the outer door and the
safe-door. With a safe-door so circumstanced, even supposing
both these outer doors forced and open, it is almost
impracticable for even a single workman, however agile or
adroit, to perform any mechanical operation whatever upon
the door, least of all upon its surrounding rabbates. These
are so close to the solid granite walls, starting out at right
angles from the rabbate all round, that he has no room to do
anything; and to get a prizing-bar at the door-rabbate, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
even to get a second man to assist the first in any way, is
impossible, simply for want of room.</p>

<p>The whole of the doors and all the surfaces of such
passage should be painted a dull, lustreless black. No one
who has not tried it, has any idea of the difficulty of
illuminating such a black passage, by even several candles,
sufficiently to perform any delicate mechanical operation;
and good light is essential to the safe-breaker.</p>

<p>In banks there is no better plan than has been ere now
adopted of making the iron safe a great cube, with the door
at one side, placing the whole safe with its bottom resting
upon the stem or plunger of an hydraulic press, the cylinder
of which is fixed in the bottom of the pit in the solid earth,
of a size capable of enabling the whole safe to be bodily
lowered down into the cavity at the end of the day’s work,
and pumped up again out of its hiding-place the next morning.
The lever of the hydraulic pump is taken away, and
the socket into which it fits is plugged, and the plug locked
into its place, and then the pump&mdash;situated in a recess in
solid masonry&mdash;is itself locked up. The top of the safe itself,
when it has been lowered to the bottom of its chamber,
stands 10 or 12 inches below the floor-level of the stone floor,
and a pair of iron doors is then closed over it and locked down.</p>

<p>A safe executed in this way, though requiring a considerable
expenditure at first, if well done, might bid defiance to
anything almost, even unlimited gunpowder, for some days.
The only addition of safety that almost could be conceived
would be that adopted at the bullion vaults of the Bank of
France in Paris, where these, situated in casemates two
stories under ground, are only approachable by one narrow,
winding staircase, which can be itself, in case of emergency,
rapidly rendered useless, and the cylindrical well in which it
is placed filled up with about 30 feet in depth of water,
which cannot be pumped out until a continuous supply be
shut off by distant means only known to one or two trusted
employés.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span></p>

<p>Since this revision has been in type the great “safes’
contest” or wager of battle between the rival safes of Mr.
Herring of New York, and Mr. Chatwood of Bolton, for
£600 a side, has come off, at the International Exhibition,
Paris, Mr. R. Mallet and Mr. Robert F. Fairlie, C.E.,
being the representatives of the English interests upon
the occasion. The result, which, owing to the conduct of
some of the parties concerned, assumed an unpleasant and
incomplete form, may be found detailed fully in a pamphlet
published by Tinsley Brothers, London. It is referred to
here because, although no decision of the wager made could
be come to, the facts ascertained are of great interest and
importance as respects the proper construction of safes.
They show conclusively that an effectively constructed door
and jambs is really the one thing needful to absolute security,
provided the safe itself be built up, as we have urged, into
masonry.</p>

<p>They also show that there are good grounds for doubting
that the American (Herring’s) “safe within safe” construction,
with a thick mass of so-called fire-proofing powdery composition
between them, is at all as protective against mere
violence and the persevering use of wedges, as Chatwood’s
simpler but far more effective construction, especially of his
door and jambs. If one of the latter safes, wholly of steel
plating, be fairly embedded into masonry, and another outside
flush door of his construction, with curved rabbates
and hooking locking bolts, be supplied to the masonry ope
itself, it is scarcely an exaggeration to call such a safe
“Invincible,” so far as anything that burglars, in any civilised
place in Europe at least, can effect.</p>
